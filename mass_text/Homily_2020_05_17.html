The Indian spiritual writer, Anthony de Mello, tells the story of a woman who stops a man walking down the street. She says, “Henry, I am so happy to see you after all these years. My, how you have changed.” She continues, “I remember you as being tall and you seem so much shorter now.” “Good grief how you have changed in five years.” Finally, the man got a chance to interject: “But my name isn’t Henry!” To which the persistent woman calmly responded, “Oh, so you changed your name, too!” The parable makes a simple point: “Once a belief is in place, we screen what we see and hear in a biased way that ensures our beliefs are ‘proven’ correct.”  We can all do this but at great cost to encountering the Easter Mystery.

It’s important in our life of faith that we acknowledge that belief is both precious and tenuous. Belief represents a bias, a way of seeing things and interpreting reality. We can be wrong in what we believe but also in how we live this belief. There is great joy in Samaria in today’s first reading because Philip’s words and actions are in accord with the truth of Christ. God was alive in him as he preached, healed, and exorcised evil spirits. It was his lively, wholesome faith that allowed the Samaritans to become of one accord. Presumably, this day, the whole city became Christian! Their old biases exposed and bad beliefs upended, these folks had room to receive the honest-to-God truth of things right from Philip’s mouth. The truth about Christ is just so appealing and attractive when the evangelizer is fully captive to grace.

Let us be honest too that while we may profess a true creed, we are not fully free of bad belief. Indeed, we may say we believe in God but actually not trust God’s ways. Our belief in God ought not make us blind to truth as the woman in de Mello’s parable. The point of Christian faith is not to be certain or correct but to meet in the mystery of personhood and to love as Jesus, who gave himself “for the sake of the unrighteous” (1 Pt 3). Thus today’s reading from Acts of the Apostles puts two important questions to us Easter disciples: Are we open as the Samaritans to welcome such a Spirit-filled Philip? And second, am I so alive in faith to convince a whole city to love God and neighbor as Jesus? There’s faith agenda for us!

Samaria was so changed and alive in joy that the apostles in Jerusalem travelled 692 miles, a full day’s journey, to greet, celebrate, and pray with them. Peter, the first pope, made this journey “that they might receive the Holy Spirit” (Acts 8). In other words, there was still “more” to be had for them beyond the healings, exorcisms, and change of habits. There was the confirmation of the Spirit to be given, “for it had not yet fallen upon any of them” (Acts 8). As you might guess, this is from whence comes our theology of the sacrament of confirmation. And it comes in the context of the fellowship of churches and the laying on of episcopal hands. Jesus had promised this “Advocate to be with you always, the Spirit of truth, whom the world cannot accept” (Jn 14), but you do.

Jesus said, “If you love me, you will keep my commandments” (Jn 14). And in another place, “love your enemies” (Mt 6). Such a love only makes sense to the one who has been truly catechized in Christ who, from the cross, bowed to mercy and respect for those who killed him. This is the full transformation of the Spirit we seek, and soon we will again be able to share this communion of Trinitarian love in spirit and truth when again we gather in this church. Let us not be persistent in being right, in being confirmed in our truth of things, but in being confirmed by the Spirit to love as Jesus loved.
