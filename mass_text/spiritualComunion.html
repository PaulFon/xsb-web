<h4>Spiritual Communion</h4>
<p>
An Act of Spiritual Communion<br class="sline">
My Jesus, I believe that You are present <br class="sline">
in the Most Holy Sacrament. <br class="sline">
I love You above all things, <br class="sline">
and I desire to receive You into my soul.<br class="sline">
Since I cannot at this moment <br class="sline">
receive You sacramentally, <br class="sline">
come at least spiritually into my heart. <br class="sline">
I embrace You as if You were already there <br class="sline">
and unite myself wholly to You. <br class="sline">
Never permit me to be separated from You. Amen</p>
