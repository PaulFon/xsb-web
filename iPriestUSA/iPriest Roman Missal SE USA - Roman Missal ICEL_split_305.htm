<h3 class="calibre2">The sign of a life consecrated to God</h3>

<p class="rubric">71. The following Preface is
said on the Solemnities and Feasts of Holy Virgins and Religious. It may also
be said on their Memorials. </p>

<p class="calibre6">The Lord be with you.</p>

<p class="response">And with your spirit.</p>

<p class="calibre6">Lift up your hearts.</p>

<p class="response">We lift them up to the Lord.</p>

<p class="calibre6">Let us give thanks to the Lord our God.</p>

<p class="response">It is right and just.</p>

<p class="calibre6">It is truly right and just, our duty and our salvation,
always and everywhere to give you thanks, Lord, holy Father, almighty and
eternal God. </p>

<p class="calibre6">For in the Saints who consecrated themselves
to Christ for the sake of the Kingdom of Heaven, it is right to celebrate the
wonders of your providence, by which you call human nature back to its original
holiness and bring it to experience on this earth the gifts you promise in the
new world to come. </p>

<p class="calibre6">And so, with all the Angels and Saints, we
praise you, as without end we acclaim: </p>

<p class="all">Holy, Holy, Holy Lord God of hosts.
Heaven and earth are full of your glory. Hosanna in the highest. Blessed is he
who comes in the name of the Lord. Hosanna in the highest.</p>
