THE LITURGY OF THE EUCHARIST</h2>

<p class="rubric">The Priest goes to the altar and
begins the Liturgy of the Eucharist in the usual way.<br class="wordsection"/>
It is desirable that the bread and wine be brought forward by the newly
baptised or, if they are children, by their parents or godparents.</p>

<h3 class="calibre2">Prayer over the Offerings </h3>

<p class="calibre6">Accept, we ask, O Lord,<br class="wordsection"/>
the prayers of your people<br class="wordsection"/>
with the sacrificial offerings,<br class="wordsection"/>
that what has begun in the paschal mysteries<br class="wordsection"/>
may, by the working of your power, <br class="wordsection"/>
bring us to the healing of eternity. </p>

<p class="calibre6">Through Christ our Lord.</p>

<h3 class="calibre2">Preface I of Easter, The Paschal Mystery.</h3>

<p class="calibre6">The Lord be with you.</p>

<p class="response">And with your spirit.</p>

<p class="calibre6">Lift up your hearts.</p>

<p class="response">We lift them up to the Lord.</p>

<p class="calibre6">Let us give thanks to the Lord our God.</p>

<p class="response">It is right and just.</p>

<p class="calibre6">It is truly right and just, our duty and our
salvation, <br class="wordsection"/>
at all times to acclaim you, O Lord, <br class="wordsection"/>
but on this night above all to laud you <br class="wordsection"/>
yet more gloriously, <br class="wordsection"/>
when Christ our Passover has been sacrificed. </p>

<p class="calibre6">For he is the true Lamb who has taken away
the sins of the world; <br class="wordsection"/>
by dying he has destroyed our death, <br class="wordsection"/>
and by rising, restored our life. </p>

<p class="calibre6">Therefore, overcome with paschal joy, <br class="wordsection"/>
every land, every people exults in your praise <br class="wordsection"/>
and even the heavenly Powers, <br class="wordsection"/>
with the angelic hosts, sing together the unending hymn of your glory, <br class="wordsection"/>
as they acclaim: </p>

<p class="all">Holy, Holy, Holy Lord God of hosts.
Heaven and earth are full of your glory. Hosanna in the highest. Blessed is he
who comes in the name of the Lord. Hosanna in the highest.</p>

<p class="rubric">When the <a href="iPriest%20Roman%20Missal%20SE%20USA%20-%20Roman%20Missal%20ICEL_split_321.htm#EP1.3">Roman Canon is used</a>, the proper forms of the Communicantes (In communion with
those) and Hanc igitur (Therefore, Lord, we pray) are said.</p>

<p class="rubric">In the Eucharistic Prayer, a
commemoration is made of the baptised and their godparents in accord with the
formulas which are found in the Roman Missal and Roman Ritual for each of the
Eucharistic Prayers.</p>

<p class="rubric">Before the Ecce Agnus Dei
(Behold the Lamb of God), the Priest may briefly address the newly baptised
about receiving their first Communion and about the excellence of this great
mystery, which is the climax of Initiation and the center of the whole of Christian life.</p>

<p class="rubric">It is desirable that the newly
baptised receive Holy Communion under both kinds, together with their
godfathers, godmothers, and Catholic parents and spouses, as well as their lay
catechists. It is even appropriate that, with the consent of the Diocesan
Bishop, where the occasion suggests this, all the faithful be admitted to Holy
Communion under both kinds.</p>

<p class="anth">Communion Antiphon | 1 Cor 5: 7-8 </p>

<p class="ant">Christ our Passover has been
sacrificed; therefore let as keep the feast with the unleavened bread of purity
and truth, alleluia.</p>

<p class="rubric">Psalm 118 (117) may
appropriately be sung.</p>

<h3 class="calibre2">Prayer after Communion</h3>

<p class="calibre6">Pour out on us, O Lord, the Spirit of your
love,<br class="wordsection"/>
and in your kindness make those you have nourished <br class="wordsection"/>
by this paschal Sacrament<br class="wordsection"/>
one in mind and heart.</p>

<p class="calibre6">Through Christ our Lord.</p>

<h3 class="calibre2">Solemn Blessing</h3>

<p class="calibre6">May almighty God bless you<br class="wordsection"/>
through today’s Easter Solemnity <br class="wordsection"/>
and, in his compassion,<br class="wordsection"/>
defend you from every assault of sin. </p>

<p class="response">Amen.</p>

<p class="calibre6">And may he, who restores you to eternal life <br class="wordsection"/>
in the Resurrection of his Only Begotten, <br class="wordsection"/>
endow you with the prize of immortality.</p>

<p class="response">Amen.</p>

<p class="calibre6">Now that the days of the Lord’s Passion have
drawn to a close, <br class="wordsection"/>
may you who celebrate the gladness of the Paschal Feast<br class="wordsection"/>
come with Christ’s help, and exulting in spirit,<br class="wordsection"/>
to those feasts that are celebrated in eternal joy.</p>

<p class="response">Amen.</p>

<p class="calibre6">And may the blessing of almighty God,<br class="wordsection"/>
the Father, and the Son, <span class="red1">+</span> and the Holy Spirit, <br class="wordsection"/>
come down on you and remain with you for ever. </p>

<p class="response">Amen.</p>

<p class="rubric">The final blessing formula from
the Rite of Baptism of Adults or of Children may also be used, according to
circumstances.</p>

<p class="rubric">To dismiss the people the Deacon
or, if there is no Deacon, the Priest himself sings or says:</p>

<p class="calibre6">Go forth, the Mass is ended, alleluia,
alleluia.</p>

<p class="rubric">Or:</p>

<p class="calibre6">Go in peace, alleluia, alleluia.</p>

<p class="rubric">All reply:</p>

<p class="calibre6">Thanks be to God, alleluia, alleluia.</p>

<p class="rubric">This practice is observed throughout the Octave of Easter.<br class="wordsection"/>
The paschal candle is lit in all the more solemn liturgical celebrations of this period.</p>
