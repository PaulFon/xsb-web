IN ORDINARY TIME </h2>

<h3 class="calibre2">The salvation of man by a man</h3>

<p class="rubric">54. The following Preface is
said on Sundays in Ordinary Time. </p>

<p class="calibre6">The Lord be with you.</p>

<p class="response">And with your spirit.</p>

<p class="calibre6">Lift up your hearts.</p>

<p class="response">We lift them up to the Lord.</p>

<p class="calibre6">Let us give thanks to the Lord our God.</p>

<p class="response">It is right and just.</p>

<p class="calibre6">It is truly right and just, our duty and our
salvation, always and everywhere to give you thanks, Lord, holy Father,
almighty and eternal God. </p>

<p class="calibre6">For we know it belongs to your boundless
glory, that you came to the aid of mortal beings with your divinity and even
fashioned for us a remedy out of mortality itself, that the cause of our
downfall might become the means of our salvation, through Christ our Lord. </p>

<p class="calibre6">Through him the host of Angels adores your
majesty and rejoices in your presence for ever. May our voices, we pray, join
with theirs in one chorus of exultant praise, as we acclaim: </p>

<p class="all">Holy, Holy, Holy Lord God of hosts.
Heaven and earth are full of your glory. Hosanna in the highest. Blessed is he
who comes in the name of the Lord. Hosanna in the highest.</p>
