<p class="rubric"><img border="0" id="_x0000_i1162" src="pc.gif" class="calibre12"/>108.
The Priest, with hands extended, says: </p>

<p class="calibre6">You are indeed Holy, O Lord, <br class="wordsection"/>
and all you have created rightly gives you praise, <br class="wordsection"/>
for through your Son our Lord Jesus Christ, <br class="wordsection"/>
by the power and working of the Holy Spirit, <br class="wordsection"/>
you give life to all things and make them holy, <br class="wordsection"/>
and you never cease to gather a people to yourself, <br class="wordsection"/>
so that from the rising of the sun to its setting <br class="wordsection"/>
a pure sacrifice may be offered to your name. </p>

<p class="rubric"><img border="0" id="_x0000_i1161" src="cc.gif" class="calibre12"/>109.
He joins his hands and, holding them extended over the offerings, says: </p>

<p class="calibre6">Therefore, O Lord, we humbly implore you: <br class="wordsection"/>
by the same Spirit graciously make holy these gifts <br class="wordsection"/>
we have brought to you for consecration, </p>

<p class="rubric">He joins his hands and makes the
Sign of the Cross once over the bread and chalice together, saying: </p>

<p class="calibre6">that they may become <br class="wordsection"/>
the Body and <span class="red1">+</span> Blood of your Son our Lord Jesus Christ, </p>

<p class="rubric">He joins his hands. </p>

<p class="calibre6">at whose command we celebrate these
mysteries. </p>

<p class="rubric">110. In the formulas that
follow, the words of the Lord should be pronounced clearly and distinctly, as
the nature of these words requires. </p>

<p class="calibre6">For on the night he was betrayed </p>

<p class="rubric">He takes the bread and, holding
it slightly raised above the altar, continues: </p>

<p class="calibre6">he himself took bread, and, giving you
thanks, <br class="wordsection"/>
he said the blessing, <br class="wordsection"/>
broke the bread and gave it to his disciples, saying: </p>

<p class="rubric">He bows slightly. </p>

<p class="calibre6">TAKE THIS, ALL OF YOU, AND EAT OF IT, <br class="wordsection"/>
FOR THIS IS MY BODY, WHICH WILL BE GIVEN UP FOR YOU.</p>

<p class="rubric">He shows the consecrated host to
the people, places it again on the paten, and genuflects in adoration. After
this, he continues: </p>

<p class="calibre6">In a similar way, when supper was ended, </p>

<p class="rubric">He takes the chalice and,
holding it slightly raised above the altar, continues: </p>

<p class="calibre6">he took the chalice, and, giving you thanks,
he said the blessing, and gave the chalice to his disciples, saying: </p>

<p class="rubric">He bows slightly. </p>

<p class="calibre6">TAKE THIS, ALL OF YOU, AND DRINK FROM IT, <br class="wordsection"/>
FOR THIS IS THE CHALICE OF MY BLOOD, <br class="wordsection"/>
THE BLOOD OF THE NEW AND ETERNAL COVENANT, <br class="wordsection"/>
WHICH WILL BE POURED OUT FOR YOU <br class="wordsection"/>
AND FOR MANY FOR THE FORGIVENESS OF SINS. </p>

<p class="calibre6">DO THIS IN MEMORY OF ME. </p>

<p class="rubric">He shows the chalice to the
people, places it on the corporal, and genuflects in adoration. </p>

<p class="rubric"><img border="0" id="_x0000_i1160" src="pc.gif" class="calibre12"/>112.
Then he says: </p>

<p class="calibre6">The mystery of faith. </p>

<p class="rubric">And the people continue,
acclaiming: </p>

<p class="response">We proclaim your Death, O
Lord, <br class="wordsection"/>
and profess your Resurrection until you come again. </p>

<p class="rubric">or: </p>

<p class="response">When we eat this Bread and
drink this Cup, <br class="wordsection"/>
we proclaim your Death, O Lord, until you come again. </p>

<p class="rubric">or: </p>

<p class="response">Save us, Saviour of the world,
<br class="wordsection"/>
for by your Cross and Resurrection you have set us free. </p>

<p class="rubric"><img border="0" id="_x0000_i1159" src="cc.gif" class="calibre12"/>113.
Then the Priest, with hands extended, says: </p>

<p class="calibre6">Therefore, O Lord, as we celebrate the memorial
of the saving Passion of your Son, <br class="wordsection"/>
his wondrous Resurrection and Ascension into heaven, <br class="wordsection"/>
and as we look forward to his second coming, <br class="wordsection"/>
we offer you in thanksgiving this holy and living sacrifice. </p>

<p class="calibre6">Look, we pray, upon the oblation of your
Church and, <br class="wordsection"/>
recognizing the sacrificial Victim <br class="wordsection"/>
by whose death you willed to reconcile us to yourself, <br class="wordsection"/>
grant that we, who are nourished by the Body and Blood of your Son and filled
with his Holy Spirit, <br class="wordsection"/>
may become one body, one spirit in Christ. </p>

<p class="calibre6"><img border="0" id="_x0000_i1158" src="c1.gif" class="calibre12"/>May he make
of us an eternal offering to you, <br class="wordsection"/>
so that we may obtain an inheritance with your elect, <br class="wordsection"/>
especially with the most Blessed Virgin Mary, Mother of God, with blessed
Joseph, her Spouse, <br class="wordsection"/>
with your blessed Apostles and glorious Martyrs <br class="wordsection"/>
<span class="red1">(</span>with Saint <span class="red1">N.</span> - the Saint of the day or Patron Saint<span class="red1">)</span><br class="wordsection"/>
and with all the Saints, <br class="wordsection"/>
on whose constant intercession in your presence <br class="wordsection"/>
we rely for unfailing help. </p>

<p class="calibre6"><img border="0" id="_x0000_i1157" src="c2.gif" class="calibre12"/>May this
Sacrifice of our reconciliation, we pray, O Lord,<br class="wordsection"/>
advance the peace and salvation of all the world. <br class="wordsection"/>
Be pleased to confirm in faith and charity <br class="wordsection"/>
your pilgrim Church on earth, <br class="wordsection"/>
with your servant <span class="red1">Francis</span> our Pope and <span class="red1">N.</span> our
Bishop, <br class="wordsection"/>
the Order of Bishops, all the clergy, <br class="wordsection"/>
and the entire people you have gained for your own. </p>

<p class="calibre6">Remember also, Lord,<br class="wordsection"/>
your servants reborn in Baptism<br class="wordsection"/>
whom you have been pleased to confirm<br class="wordsection"/>
by bestowing the Holy Spirit:<br class="wordsection"/>
in your mercy, we pray, keep safe in them your grace.</p>

<p class="calibre6">Listen graciously to the prayers of this
family, <br class="wordsection"/>
whom you have summoned before you: <br class="wordsection"/>
in your compassion, O merciful Father, <br class="wordsection"/>
gather to yourself all your children <br class="wordsection"/>
scattered throughout the world. </p>

<p class="calibre6"><img border="0" id="_x0000_i1156" src="c3.gif" class="calibre12"/>To our
departed brothers and sisters <br class="wordsection"/>
and to all who were pleasing to you at their passing from this life, give kind
admittance to your kingdom. <br class="wordsection"/>
There we hope to enjoy for ever the fullness of your glory </p>

<p class="rubric">He joins his hands. </p>

<p class="calibre6">through Christ our Lord, <br class="wordsection"/>
through whom you bestow on the world all that is good. </p>

<p class="rubric"><img border="0" id="_x0000_i1155" src="pcc.gif" class="calibre12"/>114.
He takes the chalice and the paten with the host and, raising both, he says: </p>

<p class="calibre6">Through him, and with him, and in him, <br class="wordsection"/>
O God, almighty Father, <br class="wordsection"/>
in the unity of the Holy Spirit, <br class="wordsection"/>
all glory and honour is yours, <br class="wordsection"/>
for ever and ever.</p>

<p class="rubric">The people acclaim: </p>

<p class="response">Amen. | <a href="iPriest%20Roman%20Missal%20SE%20USA%20-%20Roman%20Missal%20ICEL_split_347.htm#CR">Then follows the Communion Rite.</a></p>
