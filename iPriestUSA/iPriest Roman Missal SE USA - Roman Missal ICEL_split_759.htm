MARRIAGE</h2>

<p class="rubric">Whenever Marriage is celebrated
during Mass, this Ritual Mass is used, with the colour white or a festive
colour.</p>

<p class="rubric">However, on those days listed in
nos. 1-4 of the Table of Liturgical Days, the Mass of the day is used, retaining
the Nuptial Blessing in the Mass and, if appropriate, the proper formula for
the final blessing.</p>

<p class="rubric">If, however, during Christmas
Time and Ordinary Time, the parish community participates in a Sunday Mass
during which Marriage is celebrated, the Mass of the Sunday is used.</p>

<p class="rubric">Although complete Mass
formularies are given here for the sake of convenience, all texts, especially
the prayers and the Nuptial Blessing, may be exchanged, if appropriate, with
others.</p>
