<h2 id="calibre_toc_876" class="calibre10">Chapter III: Duties and Ministries in the Mass</h2>

<p class="girm">91. The celebration of the Eucharist is the action of Christ and
of the Church, namely, of the holy people united and ordered under the Bishop.
It therefore pertains to the whole Body of the Church, manifests it, and has
its effect upon it. Indeed, it also affects the individual members of the
Church in a different way, according to their different orders, functions, and
actual participation.<a href="iPriest%20Roman%20Missal%20SE%20USA%20-%20Roman%20Missal%20ICEL_split_884.htm#fn-74"> [74]</a><a id="fn-74-bl"></a> In this
way, the Christian people, “a chosen race, a royal Priesthood, a holy nation, a
people for his own possession,” expresses its cohesion and its hierarchical
ordering.<a href="iPriest%20Roman%20Missal%20SE%20USA%20-%20Roman%20Missal%20ICEL_split_884.htm#fn-75"> [75]</a><a id="fn-75-bl"></a> All, therefore,
whether ordained ministers or lay Christian faithful, in fulfilling their
function or their duty, should carry out solely but totally that which pertains
to them.<a href="iPriest%20Roman%20Missal%20SE%20USA%20-%20Roman%20Missal%20ICEL_split_884.htm#fn-76"> [76]</a><a id="fn-76-bl"></a></p>

<h5 class="calibre31">I. The Duties of Those in Holy Orders</h5>

<p class="girm">92. Every legitimate celebration of the Eucharist is directed by
the Bishop, either in person or through Priests who are his helpers.<a href="iPriest%20Roman%20Missal%20SE%20USA%20-%20Roman%20Missal%20ICEL_split_884.htm#fn-77"> [77]</a><a id="fn-77-bl"></a></p>

<p class="girm">When the Bishop is present at a Mass where the people are
gathered, it is most fitting that he himself celebrate the Eucharist and associate
Priests with himself in the sacred action as concelebrants. This is done not
for the sake of adding outward solemnity to the rite, but to signify more
vividly the mystery of the Church, “the sacrament of unity.”<a href="iPriest%20Roman%20Missal%20SE%20USA%20-%20Roman%20Missal%20ICEL_split_884.htm#fn-78">
[78]</a><a id="fn-78-bl"></a></p>

<p class="girm">If, on the other hand, the Bishop does not celebrate the
Eucharist but has assigned it to someone else to do this, then it is
appropriate that he should preside over the Liturgy of the Word, wearing the
pectoral cross, stole, and cope over an alb, and that he should give the
blessing at the end of Mass.<a href="iPriest%20Roman%20Missal%20SE%20USA%20-%20Roman%20Missal%20ICEL_split_884.htm#fn-79"> [79]</a><a id="fn-79-bl"></a></p>

<p class="girm">93. A Priest, also, who possesses within the Church the sacred
power of Orders to offer sacrifice in the person of Christ,<a href="iPriest%20Roman%20Missal%20SE%20USA%20-%20Roman%20Missal%20ICEL_split_884.htm#fn-80">
[80]</a><a id="fn-80-bl"></a> presides by this fact over the faithful people
gathered here and now, presides over their prayer, proclaims to them the
message of salvation, associates the people with himself in the offering of
sacrifice through Christ in the Holy Spirit to God the Father, and gives his brothers
and sisters the Bread of eternal life and partakes of it with them. Therefore,
when he celebrates the Eucharist, he must serve God and the people with dignity
and humility, and by his bearing and by the way he pronounces the divine words
he must convey to the faithful the living presence of Christ.</p>

<p class="girm">94. After the Priest, the Deacon, in virtue of the sacred
Ordination he has received, holds first place among those who minister in the
celebration of the Eucharist. For the sacred Order of the Diaconate has been
held in high honour in the Church even from the early time of the Apostles.<a href="iPriest%20Roman%20Missal%20SE%20USA%20-%20Roman%20Missal%20ICEL_split_884.htm#fn-81"> [81]</a><a id="fn-81-bl"></a> At Mass the Deacon has his own
part in proclaiming the Gospel, from time to time in preaching God’s Word, in
announcing the intentions of the Universal Prayer, in ministering to the
Priest, in preparing the altar and in serving the celebration of the Sacrifice,
in distributing the Eucharist to the faithful, especially under the species of
wine, and from time to time in giving instructions regarding the people’s
gestures and posture.</p>

<h5 class="calibre31">II. The Functions of the People of God</h5>

<p class="girm">95. In the celebration of Mass the faithful form a holy people, a
people of God’s own possession and a royal Priesthood, so that they may give
thanks to God and offer the unblemished sacrificial Victim not only by means of
the hands of the Priest but also together with him and so that they may learn
to offer their very selves.<a href="iPriest%20Roman%20Missal%20SE%20USA%20-%20Roman%20Missal%20ICEL_split_884.htm#fn-82"> [82]</a><a id="fn-82-bl"></a> They
should, moreover, take care to show this by their deep religious sense and
their charity toward brothers and sisters who participate with them in the same
celebration.</p>

<p class="girm">They are consequently to avoid any appearance of singularity or
division, keeping in mind that they have only one Father in heaven and that
hence are all brothers or sisters one to the other.</p>

<p class="girm">96. Moreover, they are to form one body, whether in hearing the
Word of God, or in taking part in the prayers and in the singing, or above all
by the common offering of the Sacrifice and by participating together at the
Lord’s table. This unity is beautifully apparent from the gestures and bodily
postures observed together by the faithful.</p>

<p class="girm">97. The faithful, moreover, should not refuse to serve the People
of God in gladness whenever they are asked to perform some particular service
or function in the celebration.</p>

<h5 class="calibre31">III. Particular Ministries</h5>

<h4 class="calibre5">The Ministry of the Instituted Acolyte and Lector</h4>

<p class="girm">98. The acolyte is instituted for service at the altar and to
assist the Priest and Deacon. It is his place principally to prepare the altar
and the sacred vessels and, if necessary, to distribute the Eucharist to the
faithful as an extraordinary minister.<a href="iPriest%20Roman%20Missal%20SE%20USA%20-%20Roman%20Missal%20ICEL_split_884.htm#fn-83"> [83]</a><a id="fn-83-bl"></a></p>

<p class="girm">In the ministry of the altar, the acolyte has his own proper
functions (cf. nos. 187-193), which he must carry out in person.</p>

<p class="girm">99. The lector is instituted to proclaim the readings from Sacred
Scripture, with the exception of the Gospel. He may also announce the
intentions for the Universal Prayer and, in the absence of a psalmist, recite
the Psalm between the readings.</p>

<p class="girm">In the celebration of the Eucharist, the lector has his own
proper function (cf. nos. 194-198), which he himself must carry out.</p>

<h4 class="calibre5">Other Functions</h4>

<p class="girm">100. In the absence of an instituted acolyte, there may be
deputed lay ministers to serve at the altar and assist the Priest and the
Deacon; these carry the cross, the candles, the thurible, the bread, the wine,
and the water, or who are even deputed to distribute Holy Communion as
extraordinary ministers.<a href="iPriest%20Roman%20Missal%20SE%20USA%20-%20Roman%20Missal%20ICEL_split_884.htm#fn-84"> [84]</a><a id="fn-84-bl"></a></p>

<p class="girm">101. In the absence of an instituted lector, other lay people may
be deputed to proclaim the readings from Sacred Scripture, people who are truly
suited to carrying out this function and carefully prepared, so that by their
hearing the readings from the sacred texts the faithful may conceive in their
hearts a sweet and living affection for Sacred Scripture.<a href="iPriest%20Roman%20Missal%20SE%20USA%20-%20Roman%20Missal%20ICEL_split_884.htm#fn-85"> [85]</a><a id="fn-85-bl"></a></p>

<p class="girm">102. It is the psalmist’s place to sing the Psalm or other
biblical canticle to be found between the readings. To carry out this function
correctly, it is necessary for the psalmist to be accomplished in the art of
singing Psalms and have a facility in public speaking and elocution.</p>

<p class="girm">103. Among the faithful, the schola cantorum or choir exercises
its own liturgical function, its place being to take care that the parts proper
to it, in keeping with the different genres of chant, are properly carried out
and to foster the active participation of the faithful by means of the singing.<a href="iPriest%20Roman%20Missal%20SE%20USA%20-%20Roman%20Missal%20ICEL_split_884.htm#fn-86"> [86]</a><a id="fn-86-bl"></a> What is said about the schola
cantorum also applies, with due regard for the relevant norms, to other
musicians, and especially the organist.</p>

<p class="girm">104. It is fitting that there be a cantor or a choir director to
direct and support the people’s singing. Indeed, when there is no choir, it is
up to the cantor to direct the different chants, with the people taking the
part proper to them.<a href="iPriest%20Roman%20Missal%20SE%20USA%20-%20Roman%20Missal%20ICEL_split_884.htm#fn-87"> [87]</a><a id="fn-87-bl"></a></p>

<p class="girm">105. A liturgical function is also exercised by:</p>

<p class="girm">a) The sacristan, who diligently arranges the liturgical books,
the vestments, and other things that are necessary for the celebration of Mass.</p>

<p class="girm">b) The commentator, who, if appropriate, provides the faithful
briefly with explanations and exhortations so as to direct their attention to
the celebration and ensure that they are better disposed for understanding it.
The commentator’s remarks should be thoroughly prepared and notable for their
restraint. In performing this function the commentator stands in a suitable
place within sight of the faithful, but not at the ambo.</p>

<p class="girm">c) Those who take up the collections in the church.</p>

<p class="girm">d) Those who, in some regions, welcome the faithful at the church
doors, seat them appropriately, and marshal them in processions.</p>

<p class="girm">106. It is desirable, at least in cathedrals and in larger
churches, to have some competent minister or master of ceremonies, to see to
the appropriate arrangement of sacred actions and to their being carried out by
the sacred ministers and lay faithful with decorum, order, and devotion.</p>

<p class="girm">107. Liturgical functions that are not proper to the Priest or
the Deacon and are mentioned above (nos. 100-106) may even be entrusted by
means of a liturgical blessing or a temporary deputation to suitable lay
persons chosen by the pastor or the rector of the church.<a href="iPriest%20Roman%20Missal%20SE%20USA%20-%20Roman%20Missal%20ICEL_split_884.htm#fn-88"> [88]</a><a id="fn-88-bl"></a> As to the function of serving the Priest at the altar, the
norms established by the Bishop for his diocese should be observed.</p>

<h5 class="calibre31">IV. The Distribution of Functions and the Preparation of the Celebration</h5>

<p class="girm">108. One and the same Priest must always exercise the
presidential function in all of its parts, except for those parts which are
proper to a Mass at which the Bishop is present (cf. above no. 92).</p>

<p class="girm">109. If there are several present who are able to exercise the
same ministry, nothing forbids their distributing among themselves and
performing different parts of the same ministry or duty. For example, one
Deacon may be assigned to execute the sung parts, another to serve at the
altar; if there are several readings, it is well to distribute them among a
number of readers, and the same applies for other matters. However, it is not
at all appropriate that several persons divide a single element of the
celebration among themselves, e.g., that the same reading be proclaimed by two
readers, one after the other, with the exception of the Passion of the Lord.</p>

<p class="girm">110. If at a Mass with the people only one minister is present,
that minister may exercise several different functions.</p>

<p class="girm">111. There should be harmony and diligence among all those involved
in the effective preparation of each liturgical celebration in accordance with
the Missal and other liturgical books, both as regards the rites and as regards
the pastoral and musical aspects. This should take place under the direction of
the rector of the church and after consultation with the faithful in things
that directly pertain to them. However, the Priest who presides at the
celebration always retains the right of arranging those things that pertain to
him.<a href="iPriest%20Roman%20Missal%20SE%20USA%20-%20Roman%20Missal%20ICEL_split_884.htm#fn-89"> [89]</a><a id="fn-89-bl"></a></p>
