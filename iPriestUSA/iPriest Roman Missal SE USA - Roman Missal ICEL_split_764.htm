<p class="calibre6">It is truly right and just, our duty and our
salvation, <br class="wordsection"/>
always and everywhere to give you thanks,<br class="wordsection"/>
Lord, holy Father, almighty and eternal God, <br class="wordsection"/>
through Christ our Lord.</p>

<p class="calibre6">For in him you have made a new covenant with
your people,<br class="wordsection"/>
so that, as you have redeemed man and woman<br class="wordsection"/>
by the mystery of Christ’s Death and Resurrection, <br class="wordsection"/>
so in Christ you might make them<br class="wordsection"/>
partakers of divine nature<br class="wordsection"/>
and joint heirs with him of heavenly glory. </p>

<p class="calibre6">In the union of husband and wife<br class="wordsection"/>
you give a sign of Christ’s loving gift of grace, <br class="wordsection"/>
so that the Sacrament we celebrate<br class="wordsection"/>
might draw us back more deeply<br class="wordsection"/>
into the wondrous design of your love. </p>

<p class="calibre6">And so, with the Angels and all the Saints, <br class="wordsection"/>
we praise you and without end we acclaim:</p>

<p class="all">Holy, Holy, Holy Lord God of hosts.
Heaven and earth are full of your glory. Hosanna in the highest. Blessed is he
who comes in the name of the Lord. Hosanna in the highest.</p>

<p class="rubric">124. After the chalice and paten
have been set down, the Priest, with hands joined, says: </p>

<p class="calibre6">At the Saviour’s command <br class="wordsection"/>
and formed by divine teaching, we dare to say: </p>

<p class="rubric">He extends his hands and,
together with the people, continues: </p>

<p class="all">Our Father, who art in heaven, <br class="wordsection"/>
hallowed be thy name; <br class="wordsection"/>
thy kingdom come, <br class="wordsection"/>
thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven. <br class="wordsection"/>
Give us this day our daily bread, <br class="wordsection"/>
and forgive us our trespasses, <br class="wordsection"/>
as we forgive those who trespass against us; <br class="wordsection"/>
and lead us not into temptation, <br class="wordsection"/>
but deliver us from evil. </p>

<p class="rubric">After the Our Father, Deliver us
is omitted. The Priest, standing and facing the bride and bridegroom, invokes
on them God’s blessing, which is never omitted.</p>

<p class="rubric">In the invitation, if one or
both of the spouses will not be receiving Communion, the words in parentheses
are omitted. In the prayer, the words in parentheses may be omitted if it seems
that circumstances suggest it, for example, if the bride and bridegroom are
advanced in years.</p>

<p class="rubric">The bride and bridegroom
approach the altar or, if appropriate, they remain at their place and kneel.</p>

<p class="rubric">The Priest, with hands joined,
calls upon those present to pray, saying: </p>

<p class="calibre6">Let us pray to the Lord for this bride and
groom,<br class="wordsection"/>
who come to the altar as they begin their married life, <br class="wordsection"/>
that (partaking of the Body and Blood of Christ)<br class="wordsection"/>
they may always be bound together by love for one another. </p>

<p class="rubric">And all pray in silence for a
while.</p>

<p class="rubric">Then the Priest, with hands
extended over the bride and bridegroom, continues:</p>

<p class="calibre6">Holy Father,<br class="wordsection"/>
who formed man in your own image,<br class="wordsection"/>
male and female you created them,<br class="wordsection"/>
so that as husband and wife, united in body and heart,<br class="wordsection"/>
they might fulfil their calling in the world;</p>

<p class="calibre6">O God, who to reveal the great design you
formed in your love, <br class="wordsection"/>
willed that the love of spouses for each other<br class="wordsection"/>
should foreshadow the covenant<br class="wordsection"/>
you graciously made with your people,<br class="wordsection"/>
so that, by fulfillment of the sacramental sign,<br class="wordsection"/>
the mystical marriage of Christ with his Church<br class="wordsection"/>
might become manifest<br class="wordsection"/>
in the union of husband and wife among your faithful; <br class="wordsection"/>
graciously stretch out your right hand<br class="wordsection"/>
over these your servants (<span class="red1">[Bride]</span> and <span class="red1">[Groom]</span>), we pray,<br class="wordsection"/>
and pour into their hearts the power of the Holy Spirit.</p>

<p class="calibre6">Grant, O Lord,<br class="wordsection"/>
that, as they enter upon this sacramental union,<br class="wordsection"/>
they may share with one another the gifts of your love and, <br class="wordsection"/>
by being for each other a sign of your presence, <br class="wordsection"/>
become one heart and one mind.</p>

<p class="calibre6">May they also sustain, O Lord,<br class="wordsection"/>
by their deeds the home they are forming <br class="wordsection"/>
(and prepare their children <br class="wordsection"/>
to become members of your heavenly household <br class="wordsection"/>
by raising them in the way of the Gospel).</p>

<p class="calibre6">Graciously crown with your blessings <span class="red1">[Bride]</span>, your handmaid, <br class="wordsection"/>
so that, by being a good wife (and mother),<br class="wordsection"/>
she may bring warmth to her home <br class="wordsection"/>
with a love that is pure and adorn it with welcoming graciousness.</p>

<p class="calibre6">Bestow a heavenly blessing also, O Lord, on <span class="red1">[Groom]</span>, your servant,<br class="wordsection"/>
that he may be a worthy, good and faithful husband <br class="wordsection"/>
(and a provident father).</p>

<p class="calibre6">Grant, holy Father,<br class="wordsection"/>
that, desiring to approach your table<br class="wordsection"/>
as a couple joined in Marriage in your presence, <br class="wordsection"/>
they may one day have the joy<br class="wordsection"/>
of taking part in your great banquet in heaven. </p>

<p class="calibre6">Through Christ our Lord.</p>

<p class="response">Amen.</p>

<p class="rubric">The prayer Lord Jesus Christ is
omitted, and The peace of the Lord is said immediately.</p>

<p class="rubric">127. The Priest, turned towards
the people, extending and then joining his hands, adds: </p>

<p class="calibre6">The peace of the Lord be with you always. </p>

<p class="rubric">The people reply: </p>

<p class="response">And with your spirit. </p>

<p class="rubric">128. Then, if appropriate, the
Deacon, or the Priest, adds: </p>

<p class="calibre6">Let us offer each other the sign of peace. </p>

<p class="rubric">Then the bride and bridegroom
and all present offer a sign, in keeping with local customs, that expresses
peace, communion and charity.</p>

<p class="calibre6"><a href="iPriest%20Roman%20Missal%20SE%20USA%20-%20Roman%20Missal%20ICEL_split_347.htm#CR2">The Communion Rite then
continues.</a></p>

<p class="anth">Communion Antiphon | Jn 13:34</p>

<p class="ant">I give you a new commandment, that
you love one another as I have loved you, says the Lord (alleluia).</p>

<h3 class="calibre2">Prayer after Communion</h3>

<p class="calibre6">Having been made partakers at your table,<br class="wordsection"/>
we pray, O Lord,<br class="wordsection"/>
that those who are united by the Sacrament of Marriage <br class="wordsection"/>
may always hold fast to you<br class="wordsection"/>
and proclaim your Name to the world.</p>

<p class="calibre6">Through Christ our Lord.</p>

<h3 class="calibre2">Solemn Blessing at the End of Mass</h3>

<p class="rubric">The Priest, with hands extended
over the bride and bridegroom, says: </p>

<p class="calibre6">May God the all-powerful Father grant you his
joy<br class="wordsection"/>
and bless you in your children.</p>

<p class="response">Amen.</p>

<p class="calibre6">May the Only Begotten Son of God<br class="wordsection"/>
stand by you with compassion in good times and in bad. </p>

<p class="response">Amen.</p>

<p class="calibre6">May the Holy Spirit of God<br class="wordsection"/>
always pour forth his love into your hearts. </p>

<p class="response">Amen.</p>

<p class="rubric">And he blesses all the people,
adding:</p>

<p class="calibre6">And may almighty God bless all of you who are
gathered here: <br class="wordsection"/>
the Father, and the Son, <span class="red1">+</span> and the Holy Spirit.</p>

<p class="response">Amen.</p>
