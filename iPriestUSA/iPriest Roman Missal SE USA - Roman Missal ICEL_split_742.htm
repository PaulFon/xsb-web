<p class="rubric">The rite of “election” or
“enrollment of names” for catechumens who are to be admitted to the Sacraments
of Christian Initiation at the Easter Vigil should be celebrated during the
Mass of the First Sunday of Lent. If, for pastoral reasons, it is celebrated
apart from this Sunday, the Mass that follows may be used with the colour
violet on any day except those listed in nos. 1-4 of the Table of Liturgical
Days. The Mass of the Friday of the Fourth Week of Lent may also be used.</p>
