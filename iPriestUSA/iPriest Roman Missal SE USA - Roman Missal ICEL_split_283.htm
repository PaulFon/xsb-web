<h3 class="calibre2">The Paschal Mystery and the People of God</h3>

<p class="rubric">52. The following Preface is
said on Sundays in Ordinary Time. </p>

<p class="calibre6">The Lord be with you.</p>

<p class="response">And with your spirit.</p>

<p class="calibre6">Lift up your hearts.</p>

<p class="response">We lift them up to the Lord.</p>

<p class="calibre6">Let us give thanks to the Lord our God.</p>

<p class="response">It is right and just.</p>

<p class="calibre6">It is truly right and just, our duty and our
salvation, always and everywhere to give you thanks, Lord, holy Father, almighty
and eternal God, through Christ our Lord. </p>

<p class="calibre6">For through his Paschal Mystery, he
accomplished the marvellous deed, by which he has freed us from the yoke of sin
and death, summoning us to the glory of being now called a chosen race, a royal
priesthood, a holy nation, a people for your own possession, to proclaim
everywhere your mighty works, for you have called us out of darkness into your
own wonderful light. </p>

<p class="calibre6">And so, with Angels and Archangels, with
Thrones and Dominions, and with all the hosts and Powers of heaven, we sing the
hymn of your glory, as without end we acclaim: </p>

<p class="all">Holy, Holy, Holy Lord God of hosts.
Heaven and earth are full of your glory. Hosanna in the highest. Blessed is he
who comes in the name of the Lord. Hosanna in the highest.</p>
