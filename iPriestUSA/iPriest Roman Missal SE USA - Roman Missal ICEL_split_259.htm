of all things visible and invisible. </p>

<p class="all">I believe in one Lord Jesus Christ,
<br class="wordsection"/>
the Only Begotten Son of God, <br class="wordsection"/>
born of the Father before all ages. <br class="wordsection"/>
God from God, Light from Light, <br class="wordsection"/>
true God from true God, begotten, not made, <br class="wordsection"/>
consubstantial with the Father; <br class="wordsection"/>
through him all things were made. <br class="wordsection"/>
For us men and for our salvation he came down from heaven, </p>

<p class="rubric">At the words that follow up to
and including “and became man,” all bow.</p>

<p class="all">and by the Holy Spirit was
incarnate of the Virgin Mary, <br class="wordsection"/>
and became man. </p>

<p class="all">For our sake he was crucified under
Pontius Pilate, <br class="wordsection"/>
he suffered death and was buried, and rose again on the third day in accordance
with the Scriptures. <br class="wordsection"/>
He ascended into heaven and is seated at the right hand of the Father. </p>

<p class="all">He will come again in glory to
judge the living and the dead <br class="wordsection"/>
and his kingdom will have no end. </p>

<p class="all">I believe in the Holy Spirit, <br class="wordsection"/>
the Lord, the giver of life, <br class="wordsection"/>
who proceeds from the Father and the Son, <br class="wordsection"/>
who with the Father and the Son is adored and glorified, <br class="wordsection"/>
who has spoken through the prophets. </p>

<p class="all">I believe in one, holy, catholic
and apostolic Church. <br class="wordsection"/>
I confess one Baptism for the forgiveness of sins <br class="wordsection"/>
and I look forward to the resurrection of the dead <br class="wordsection"/>
and the life of the world to come. Amen. </p>
