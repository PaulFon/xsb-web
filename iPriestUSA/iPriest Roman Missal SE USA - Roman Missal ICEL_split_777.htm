<h2 id="calibre_toc_783" class="calibre10"><a class="calibre3" id="RMCDA"></a>2. FOR THE DEDICATION OF
AN ALTAR</h2>

<p class="rubric">When an altar is dedicated, the
proper Ritual Mass is normally used, with the colour white or a festive colour.
The dedication of an altar, however, is not to take place during the Paschal
Triduum, on Ash Wednesday, on the weekdays of Holy Week, or on the
Commemoration of All the Faithful Departed (All Souls’ Day). </p>

<p class="rubric">On the Nativity of the Lord, on
the Epiphany, on the Ascension, on Pentecost Sunday, as well as on the Sundays
of Advent, Lent, and Easter, the Mass of the day is used, except for the Prayer
over the Offerings and the Preface, which are intimately connected to the rite
itself.</p>

<p class="anth">Entrance Antiphon | Ps 83:10-11</p>

<p class="ant">Turn your eyes, our God, our
shield; and look upon the face of your anointed one; one day within your courts
is better than a thousand elsewhere (alleluia).</p>

<p class="anth">or: | Ps 42:4</p>

<p class="ant">I will come to the altar of God, to
God who restores the joy of my youth (alleluia).</p>

<h3 class="calibre2">Prayer over the Offerings</h3>

<p class="calibre6">May your Holy Spirit come down upon this
altar,<br class="wordsection"/>
we pray, O Lord our God,<br class="wordsection"/>
to sanctify the gifts of your people<br class="wordsection"/>
and graciously to cleanse<br class="wordsection"/>
the hearts of all who receive them.</p>

<p class="calibre6">Through Christ our Lord.</p>

<p class="rubric">Eucharistic Prayer I or III is
said with this Preface, which is an integral part of the Rite of the Dedication
of an Altar.</p>

<h3 class="calibre2">Preface: Christ himself is the altar.</h3>

<p class="calibre6">The Lord be with you.</p>

<p class="response">And with your spirit.</p>

<p class="calibre6">Lift up your hearts.</p>

<p class="response">We lift them up to the Lord.</p>

<p class="calibre6">Let us give thanks to the Lord our God.</p>

<p class="response">It is right and just.</p>

<p class="calibre6">It is truly right and just, our duty and our
salvation, <br class="wordsection"/>
always and everywhere to give you thanks,<br class="wordsection"/>
Lord, holy Father, almighty and eternal God, <br class="wordsection"/>
through Christ our Lord.</p>

<p class="calibre6">Having become both the true priest and the
true oblation, <br class="wordsection"/>
he has taught us to celebrate for ever<br class="wordsection"/>
the memorial of the Sacrifice<br class="wordsection"/>
that he himself offered to you on the altar of the Cross.</p>

<p class="calibre6">Therefore, Lord, your people have raised this
altar, <br class="wordsection"/>
which we dedicate to you with joyful praise.<br class="wordsection"/>
Truly this is an exalted place,<br class="wordsection"/>
where the sacrifice of Christ<br class="wordsection"/>
is ever offered in mystery,<br class="wordsection"/>
where perfect praise is rendered to you <br class="wordsection"/>
and redemption flows forth for us.</p>

<p class="calibre6">Here is prepared the table of the Lord,<br class="wordsection"/>
where your children, fed by the Body of Christ, <br class="wordsection"/>
are gathered into the one, the holy Church.</p>

<p class="calibre6">Here the faithful drink of your Spirit<br class="wordsection"/>
from the streams that flow from Christ, the spiritual rock, <br class="wordsection"/>
through whom they, too, become a holy oblation, a living altar.</p>

<p class="calibre6">And so, Lord, with all the Angels and Saints,<br class="wordsection"/>
we, too, give you thanks as in exultation we acclaim:</p>

<p class="all">Holy, Holy, Holy Lord God of hosts.
Heaven and earth are full of your glory. Hosanna in the highest. Blessed is he
who comes in the name of the Lord. Hosanna in the highest.</p>

<p class="anth">Communion Antiphon | Cf. Ps 83:4-5</p>

<p class="ant">The sparrow finds a home, and the
swallow a nest for her young, at your altars, O Lord of hosts, my king and my
God. Blessed are they who dwell in your house, forever singing your praise (alleluia).</p>

<p class="anth">or: | Cf. Ps 127:3</p>

<p class="ant">Like shoots of the olive, may the
children of the Church be gathered around the table of the Lord (alleluia).</p>

<h3 class="calibre2">Prayer after Communion</h3>

<p class="calibre6">Keep us, O Lord, ever close to your altar<br class="wordsection"/>
where the Sacrament of sacrifice is celebrated, <br class="wordsection"/>
so that, united in faith and charity,<br class="wordsection"/>
we who by Christ are nourished<br class="wordsection"/>
into Christ may be transformed.</p>

<p class="calibre6">Who lives and reigns for ever and ever.</p>

<h3 class="calibre2">Solemn Blessing at the End of Mass</h3>

<p class="rubric">The Bishop, with hands extended
over the people, says: </p>

<p class="calibre6">May God, who adorns you with a royal
priesthood, <br class="wordsection"/>
grant that, as you exercise it in holiness,<br class="wordsection"/>
you may share worthily in the sacrifice of Christ. </p>

<p class="response">Amen.</p>

<p class="calibre6">And may he, <br class="wordsection"/>
who gathers you at one table and renews you with one Bread,<br class="wordsection"/>
make of you one heart and one soul. </p>

<p class="response">Amen.</p>

<p class="calibre6">By the example of your love, may you draw to
Christ<br class="wordsection"/>
those to whom you proclaim him. </p>

<p class="response">Amen.</p>

<p class="calibre6">And may the blessing of almighty God,<br class="wordsection"/>
the Father, <span class="red1">+</span> and the Son, <span class="red1">+</span> and the
Holy <span class="red1">+</span> Spirit, <br class="wordsection"/>
descend upon you and remain with you for ever.</p>

<p class="response">Amen.</p>
