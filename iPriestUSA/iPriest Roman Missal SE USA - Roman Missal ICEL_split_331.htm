<p class="rubric">The Eucharistic Prayers for
Reconciliation may be used in Masses in which the mystery of reconciliation is
conveyed to the faithful in a special way, as, for example, in the Masses for
Promoting Harmony, For Reconciliation, For the Preservation of Peace and
Justice, In Time of War or Civil Disturbance, For the Forgiveness of Sins, For
Charity, of the Mystery of the Holy Cross, of the Most Holy Eucharist, of the
Most Precious Blood of our Lord Jesus Christ, as well as in Masses during Lent.
Although these Eucharistic Prayers have been provided with a proper Preface,
they may also be used with other Prefaces that refer to penance and conversion,
as, for example, the Prefaces of Lent. </p>
