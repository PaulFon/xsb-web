<p class="calibre6">Almighty ever-living God,<br class="wordsection"/>
who gather what is scattered<br class="wordsection"/>
and keep together what you have gathered, <br class="wordsection"/>
look kindly on the flock of your Son,<br class="wordsection"/>
that those whom one Baptism has consecrated <br class="wordsection"/>
may be joined together by integrity of faith and united in the bond of charity.<br class="wordsection"/>

<p class="rubric">Or:</p>

<p class="calibre6">We humbly ask you, Lord, <br class="wordsection"/>
lover of the human family, <br class="wordsection"/>
to pour out more fully upon us the grace of your Spirit, <br class="wordsection"/>
and grant that, walking worthily in the vocation<br class="wordsection"/>
to which you have called us,<br class="wordsection"/>
we may bear witness to the truth before others<br class="wordsection"/>
and seek with confidence<br class="wordsection"/>
the unity of all believers in the bond of peace.<br class="wordsection"/>

<h3 class="calibre2">Prayer over the Offerings</h3>

<p class="calibre6">O Lord, <br class="wordsection"/>
who gained for yourself a people by adoption <br class="wordsection"/>
through the one sacrifice offered once for all,<br class="wordsection"/>
bestow graciously on us, <br class="wordsection"/>

<p class="calibre6">The Lord be with you.</p>

<p class="response">And with your spirit.</p>

<p class="calibre6">Lift up your hearts.</p>

<p class="response">We lift them up to the Lord.</p>

<p class="calibre6">Let us give thanks to the Lord our God.</p>

<p class="response">It is right and just.</p>

<p class="calibre6">It is truly right and just, our duty and our
salvation, <br class="wordsection"/>
always and everywhere to give you thanks,<br class="wordsection"/>
Lord, holy Father, almighty and eternal God, <br class="wordsection"/>
through Christ our Lord.</p>

<p class="calibre6">For through him you brought us<br class="wordsection"/>
to the knowledge of your truth,<br class="wordsection"/>
so that by the bond of one faith and one Baptism <br class="wordsection"/>
we might become his Body.<br class="wordsection"/>
Through him you poured out<br class="wordsection"/>
your Holy Spirit among all the nations so that in a wondrous manner<br class="wordsection"/>
he might prompt and engender unity in the diversity of your gifts,<br class="wordsection"/>
dwelling within your adopted children and fills and rules the whole Church.</p>

<p class="calibre6">And so, in company with the choirs of Angels,
we praise you, <br class="wordsection"/>
and with joy we proclaim:</p>

<p class="all">Holy, Holy, Holy Lord God of hosts.
Heaven and earth are full of your glory. Hosanna in the highest. Blessed is he
who comes in the name of the Lord. Hosanna in the highest.</p>
