and where you never cease to show favour<br class="wordsection"/>
to the family on pilgrimage to you in this place, <br class="wordsection"/>
you wonderfully manifest and accomplish<br class="wordsection"/>
the mystery of your communion with us.</p>

<p class="calibre6">Here you build up for yourself the temple
that we are <br class="wordsection"/>
and cause your Church, spread throughout the world, <br class="wordsection"/>
to grow ever more and more as the Lord’s own Body, <br class="wordsection"/>
till she reaches her fullness in the vision of peace,<br class="wordsection"/>
the heavenly city of Jerusalem.</p>

<p class="calibre6">And so, with the countless ranks of the
