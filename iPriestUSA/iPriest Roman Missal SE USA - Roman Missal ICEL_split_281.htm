OF THE LORD </h2>

<h3 class="calibre2">The mystery of the Ascension</h3>

<p class="rubric">50. The following Preface is
said on the day of the Ascension of the Lord. It may be said on the days
between the Ascension and Pentecost in all Masses that have no proper Preface. </p>

<p class="calibre6">The Lord be with you.</p>

<p class="response">And with your spirit.</p>

<p class="calibre6">Lift up your hearts.</p>

<p class="response">We lift them up to the Lord.</p>

<p class="calibre6">Let us give thanks to the Lord our God.</p>

<p class="response">It is right and just.</p>

<p class="calibre6">It is truly right and just, our duty and our
salvation, always and everywhere to give you thanks, Lord, holy Father,
almighty and eternal God. </p>

<p class="calibre6">For the Lord Jesus, the King of glory,
conqueror of sin and death, ascended (today) to the highest heavens, as the
Angels gazed in wonder. </p>

<p class="calibre6">Mediator between God and man, judge of the
world and Lord of hosts, he ascended not to distance himself from our lowly
state but that we, his members, might be confident of following where he, our
Head and Founder, has gone before. </p>

<p class="calibre6">Therefore, overcome with paschal joy, every
land, every people exults in your praise and even the heavenly Powers, with the
angelic hosts, sing together the unending hymn of your glory, as they acclaim: </p>

<p class="all">Holy, Holy, Holy Lord God of hosts.
Heaven and earth are full of your glory. Hosanna in the highest. Blessed is he
who comes in the name of the Lord. Hosanna in the highest.</p>
