<p class="rubric">When a church is dedicated, the
proper Ritual Mass is always used, with the colour white or a festive colour.
The dedication of a church, however, is not to take place during the Paschal
Triduum, on the Nativity of the Lord, on the Epiphany, on the Ascension, on
Pentecost Sunday, on Ash Wednesday, on the weekdays of Holy Week, or on the
Commemoration of All the Faithful Departed (All Souls’ Day).</p>

<p class="ant">God is in his holy place, God who
unites those who dwell in his house; he himself gives might and strength to his
people (alleluia).</p>

<p class="anth">Or, with Psalm 121: | Cf. Ps 121:1</p>

<p class="ant">Let us go to the house of the LORD
rejoicing (alleluia).</p>

<h3 class="calibre2">Prayer over the Offerings</h3>

<p class="calibre6">May the gifts of your joyful Church<br class="wordsection"/>

so that your people, <br class="wordsection"/>

<h3 class="calibre2">Preface: The Mystery of God’s Temple.</h3>

<p class="calibre6">The Lord be with you.</p>

<p class="response">And with your spirit.</p>

<p class="calibre6">Lift up your hearts.</p>

<p class="response">We lift them up to the Lord.</p>

<p class="calibre6">Let us give thanks to the Lord our God.</p>

<p class="response">It is right and just.</p>

<p class="calibre6">It is truly right and just, our duty and our
salvation, <br class="wordsection"/>
always and everywhere to give you thanks,<br class="wordsection"/>
Father most holy.</p>

<p class="calibre6">For you have made the whole world <br class="wordsection"/>
a temple of your glory <br class="wordsection"/>
that your Name might everywhere be extolled,<br class="wordsection"/>
yet you allow us to consecrate to you<br class="wordsection"/>
apt places for the divine mysteries.</p>

<p class="calibre6">And so we dedicate joyfully to your majesty <br class="wordsection"/>
this house of prayer, built by human labor.<br class="wordsection"/>
Here is foreshadowed the mystery of the true Temple, <br class="wordsection"/>
here is prefigured the heavenly Jerusalem.</p>

<p class="calibre6">For you made the Body of your Son, <br class="wordsection"/>
born of the tender Virgin, a temple consecrated to you,<br class="wordsection"/>
in which the fullness of the Godhead might dwell.</p>

<p class="calibre6">You also established the Church as a holy
city, <br class="wordsection"/>
built upon the foundation of the Apostles,<br class="wordsection"/>
with Christ Jesus himself the chief cornerstone: <br class="wordsection"/>
a city to be built of chosen stones<br class="wordsection"/>
given life by the Spirit and bonded by charity, <br class="wordsection"/>
where for endless ages you will be all in all,<br class="wordsection"/>
and the light of Christ will shine undimmed for ever.</p>

<p class="calibre6">Through him, O Lord, with all the Angels and
Saints, <br class="wordsection"/>
we give you thanks as in exultation we acclaim:</p>

<p class="all">Holy, Holy, Holy Lord God of hosts.
Heaven and earth are full of your glory. Hosanna in the highest. Blessed is he
who comes in the name of the Lord. Hosanna in the highest.</p>

<p class="rubric">When Mass is already celebrated
regularly in the church, Eucharistic Prayer I or III is said with this Preface.</p>

<h3 class="calibre2">Preface: From the mystery of the Temple of God, which is the Church. </h3>

<p class="calibre6">The Lord be with you.</p>

<p class="response">And with your spirit.</p>

<p class="calibre6">Lift up your hearts.</p>

<p class="response">We lift them up to the Lord.</p>

<p class="calibre6">Let us give thanks to the Lord our God.</p>

<p class="response">It is right and just.</p>

<p class="calibre6">It is truly right and just, our duty and our
salvation, <br class="wordsection"/>
always and everywhere to give you thanks,<br class="wordsection"/>
Lord, holy Father, almighty and eternal God, <br class="wordsection"/>
through Christ our Lord.</p>

<p class="calibre6">For in this visible house that you have let
us build <br class="wordsection"/>
and where you never cease to show favour<br class="wordsection"/>
to the family on pilgrimage to you in this place, <br class="wordsection"/>
you wonderfully manifest and accomplish<br class="wordsection"/>
the mystery of your communion with us.</p>

<p class="calibre6">Here you build up for yourself the temple <br class="wordsection"/>
that we are and cause your Church, <br class="wordsection"/>
spread throughout the world, <br class="wordsection"/>
to grow ever more and more as the Lord’s own Body, <br class="wordsection"/>
till she reaches her fullness in the vision of peace,<br class="wordsection"/>
the heavenly city of Jerusalem.</p>

<p class="calibre6">And so, with the countless ranks of the
blessed, <br class="wordsection"/>
in the temple of your glory we praise you,<br class="wordsection"/>
we bless you and proclaim your greatness as we acclaim:</p>

<p class="all">Holy, Holy, Holy Lord God of hosts.
Heaven and earth are full of your glory. Hosanna in the highest. Blessed is he
who comes in the name of the Lord. Hosanna in the highest.</p>

<p class="rubric">In the Eucharistic prayers, the
dedication of the church is commemorated according to the following formulas:</p>

<p class="rubric">In Eucharistic Prayer I, the
proper form of Hanc igitur (Therefore, Lord, we pray) is said:</p>

<p class="calibre6">Therefore, Lord, we pray:<br class="wordsection"/>
graciously accept this oblation of our service, <br class="wordsection"/>
and of these your servants,<br class="wordsection"/>
who in a spirit of faith<br class="wordsection"/>
have offered to you this church (in honour of <span class="red1">N.</span>) <br class="wordsection"/>
and built it with tireless labor.</p>

<p class="quietly"><span class="red1"><span class="calibre14">(</span></span>Through
Christ our Lord. Amen.<span class="red1"><span class="calibre14">)</span></span> </p>

<p class="rubric">In the intercessions of
Eucharistic Prayer III, after the words the entire people you have gained for
your own, the following is said:</p>

<p class="calibre6">Listen graciously to the prayers of this
family,<br class="wordsection"/>
which dedicates this church to you:<br class="wordsection"/>
may it be for your family a house of salvation<br class="wordsection"/>
and a place for the celebration of your heavenly Sacraments. </p>

<p class="calibre6">Here may the Gospel of peace resound<br class="wordsection"/>
and the sacred mysteries be celebrated, <br class="wordsection"/>
so that your faithful,<br class="wordsection"/>
formed by the word of life and by divine grace <br class="wordsection"/>
on their pilgrim way through the earthly city, <br class="wordsection"/>
may merit to reach the eternal Jerusalem. </p>

<p class="calibre6">There, in your compassion, O merciful Father,
<br class="wordsection"/>
gather to yourself all your children<br class="wordsection"/>
scattered throughout the earth.</p>

<p class="calibre6">Lovingly receive into your Kingdom<br class="wordsection"/>
our departed brothers and sisters and to all...</p>

<p class="anth">Communion Antiphon Cf. Mt 21:13; Lk 11:10</p>

<p class="ant">My house shall be a house of
prayer, says the Lord: in that house, the one who asks receives, the one who
seeks finds, and to the one who knocks, the door will be opened (alleluia).</p>

<p class="anth">or: | Cf. Ps 127:3</p>

<p class="ant">Like shoots of the olive, may the children
of the Church be gathered around the table of the Lord (alleluia). </p>

<h3 class="calibre2">Prayer after Communion</h3>

<p class="calibre6">Through these holy gifts we have received, <br class="wordsection"/>
O Lord, we pray,<br class="wordsection"/>
instill in our minds an increase of your truth, <br class="wordsection"/>

in your holy temple<br class="wordsection"/>
and glory in your sight with all the Saints. </p>

<p class="calibre6">Through Christ our Lord.</p>

<h3 class="calibre2">Solemn Blessing at the End of Mass</h3>

<p class="rubric">The Bishop, with hands extended
over the people, says:</p>

who has gathered you today for the dedication of this church, <br class="wordsection"/>

<p class="response">Amen.</p>

<p class="calibre6">May you be made thoroughly clean, <br class="wordsection"/>
so that God may dwell within you<br class="wordsection"/>
