THE SOLEMN BEGINNING OF THE VIGIL OR LUCERNARIUM</h2>

<h3 class="calibre2">The Blessing of the Fire and Preparation of the Candle</h3>

<p class="rubric">A blazing fire is prepared in a
suitable place outside the church. When the people are gathered there, the
Priest approaches with the ministers, one of whom carries the paschal candle.
The processional cross and candles are not carried. Where, however, a fire
cannot be lit outside the church, the rite is carried out as in no. 13, below.<br class="wordsection"/>
The Priest and faithful sign themselves while the Priest says: </p>

<p class="calibre6">In the name of the Father, and of the Son,
and of the Holy Spirit</p>

<p class="rubric">and then he greets the assembled
people in the usual way and briefly instructs them about the night vigil in
these or similar words:</p>

<p class="calibre6">Dear brethren (brothers and sisters), <br class="wordsection"/>
on this most sacred night,<br class="wordsection"/>
in which our Lord Jesus Christ passed over from death to life, <br class="wordsection"/>
the Church calls upon her sons and daughters,<br class="wordsection"/>
scattered throughout the world,<br class="wordsection"/>
to come together to watch and pray. </p>

<p class="calibre6">If we keep the memorial<br class="wordsection"/>
of the Lord’s paschal solemnity in this way, <br class="wordsection"/>
listening to his word and celebrating his mysteries,<br class="wordsection"/>
then we shall have the sure hope <br class="wordsection"/>
of sharing his triumph over death <br class="wordsection"/>
and living with him in God.</p>

<p class="rubric">Then the Priest blesses the
fire, saying with hands extended: </p>

<p class="calibre6">Let us pray.</p>

<p class="calibre6">O God, who through your Son<br class="wordsection"/>
bestowed upon the faithful the fire of your glory, <br class="wordsection"/>
sanctify <span class="red1">+</span> this new fire, we pray,<br class="wordsection"/>
and grant that,<br class="wordsection"/>
by these paschal celebrations,<br class="wordsection"/>
we may be so inflamed with heavenly desires, <br class="wordsection"/>
that with minds made pure<br class="wordsection"/>
we may attain festivities of unending splendour. </p>

<p class="calibre6">Through Christ our Lord.</p>

<p class="response">Amen.</p>

<p class="rubric">11. After the blessing of the
new fire, one of the ministers brings the paschal candle to the Priest, who
cuts a cross into the candle with a stylus. Then he makes the Greek letter
Alpha above the cross, the letter Omega below, and the four numerals of the
current year between the arms of the cross, saying meanwhile: </p>

<p class="calibre6">Christ yesterday and today;</p>

<p class="rubric">(he cuts a vertical line)</p>

<p class="calibre6">the Beginning and the End;</p>

<p class="rubric">(he cuts a horizontal line);</p>

<p class="calibre6">the Alpha</p>

<p class="rubric">(he cuts the letter Alpha above
the vertical line);</p>

<p class="calibre6">and the Omega.</p>

<p class="rubric">(he cuts the letter Omega below
the vertical line).</p>

<p class="calibre6">All time belongs to him </p>

<p class="rubric">(he cuts the first numeral of the current year in the upper left corner of the cross);</p>

<p class="calibre6">and all the ages </p>

<p class="rubric">(he cuts the second numeral of the current year in the upper right corner of the cross).</p>

<p class="calibre6">To him be glory and power </p>

<p class="rubric">(he cuts the third numeral of the current year in the lower left corner of the cross);</p>

<p class="calibre6">through every age and for ever. Amen.</p>

<p class="rubric">(he cuts the fourth numeral of the current year in the lower right corner of the cross).</p>

<p class="rubric">12. When the cutting of the
cross and of the other signs has been completed, the Priest may insert five
grains of incense into the candle in the form of a cross, meanwhile saying:</p>

<p class="calibre6">By his holy <br class="wordsection"/>
and glorious wounds,<br class="wordsection"/>
may Christ the Lord<br class="wordsection"/>
guard us<br class="wordsection"/>
and protect us. Amen.</p>

<p class="rubric">13. Where, because of difficulties that may occur, a fire is not lit, the blessing of fire is adapted
to the circumstances. When the people are gathered in the church as on other
occasions, the Priest comes to the door of the church, along with the ministers
carrying the paschal candle. The people, insofar as is possible, turn to face
the Priest. The greeting and address take place as in no. 9 above; then the
fire is blessed and the candle is prepared, as above in nos. 10-12.<br class="wordsection"/>
14. The Priest lights the paschal candle from the new fire, saying:</p>

<p class="calibre6">May the light of Christ rising in glory<br class="wordsection"/>
dispel the darkness of our hearts and minds.</p>

<p class="rubric">As regards the preceding
elements, Conferences of Bishops may also establish other forms more adapted to
the culture of the different peoples.</p>

<h3 class="calibre2">Procession</h3>

<p class="rubric">15. When the candle has been
lit, one of the ministers takes burning coals from the fire and places them in
the thurible, and the Priest puts incense into it in the usual way. The Deacon or,
if there is no Deacon, another suitable minister, takes the paschal candle and
a procession forms. The thurifer with the smoking thurible precedes the Deacon
or other minister who carries the paschal candle. After them follows the Priest
with the ministers and the people, all holding in their hands unlit candles.<br class="wordsection"/>
At the door of the church the Deacon, standing and raising up the candle,
sings:</p>

<p class="calibre6">The Light of Christ.</p>

<p class="rubric">And all reply:</p>

<p class="response">Thanks be to God.</p>

<p class="rubric">The Priest lights his candle
from the flame of the paschal candle.<br class="wordsection"/>
Then the Deacon moves forward to the middle of the church and, standing and
raising up the candle, sings a second time:</p>

<p class="calibre6">The Light of Christ.</p>

<p class="rubric">And all reply:</p>

<p class="response">Thanks be to God.</p>

<p class="rubric">All light their candles from the
flame of the paschal candle and continue in procession.<br class="wordsection"/>
When the Deacon arrives before the altar, he stands facing the people, raises
up the candle and sings a third time:</p>

<p class="calibre6">The Light of Christ.</p>

<p class="rubric">And all reply:</p>

<p class="response">Thanks be to God.</p>

<p class="rubric">Then the Deacon places the
paschal candle on a large candlestand prepared next to the ambo or in the
middle of the sanctuary.<br class="wordsection"/>
And lights are lit throughout the church, except for the altar candles.</p>

<h3 class="calibre2">The Easter Proclamation (Exsultet)</h3>

<p class="rubric">Arriving at the altar, the
Priest goes to his chair, gives his candle to a minister, puts incense into the
thurible and blesses the incense as at the Gospel at Mass. The Deacon goes to
the Priest and saying, Your blessing, Father, asks for and receives a blessing
from the Priest, who says in a low voice:</p>

<p class="calibre6">May the Lord be in your heart and on your lips,<br class="wordsection"/>
that you may proclaim his paschal praise worthily and well,<br class="wordsection"/>
in the name of the Father and of the Son, <span class="red1">+</span> and of the Holy Spirit. </p>

<p class="rubric">The Deacon replies: Amen.</p>

<p class="rubric">This blessing is omitted if the
Proclamation is made by someone who is not a Deacon.</p>

<p class="rubric">The Deacon, after incensing the
book and the candle, proclaims the Easter Proclamation (Exsultet) at the ambo
or at a lectern, with all standing and holding lighted candles in their hands.</p>

<p class="rubric">The Easter Proclamation may be
made, in the absence of a Deacon, by the Priest himself or by another
concelebrating Priest. If, however, because of necessity, a lay cantor sings
the Proclamation, the words Therefore, dearest friends up to the end of the
invitation are omitted, along with the greeting The Lord be with you. The
Proclamation may also be sung in the shorter form. </p>

<p class="calibre6"><a href="#Exult2">Exsultet - Shorter form.</a> </p>

<h3 class="calibre2">Longer Form of the Easter Proclamation</h3>

<p class="calibre6">Exult, let them exult, the hosts of heaven,
exult, <br class="wordsection"/>
let Angel ministers of God exult, let the trumpet of salvation<br class="wordsection"/>
sound aloud our mighty King’s triumph!</p>

<p class="calibre6">Be glad, let earth be glad, as glory floods
her, <br class="wordsection"/>
ablaze with light from her eternal King,<br class="wordsection"/>
let all corners of the earth be glad, <br class="wordsection"/>
knowing an end to gloom and darkness. <br class="wordsection"/>
Rejoice, let Mother Church also rejoice, <br class="wordsection"/>
arrayed with the lightning of his glory, <br class="wordsection"/>
let this holy building shake with joy,<br class="wordsection"/>
filled with the mighty voices of the peoples.</p>

<p class="calibre6">(Therefore, dearest friends,<br class="wordsection"/>
standing in the awesome glory of this holy light, <br class="wordsection"/>
invoke with me, I ask you,<br class="wordsection"/>
the mercy of God almighty,<br class="wordsection"/>
that he, who has been pleased to number me, <br class="wordsection"/>
though unworthy, among the Levites,<br class="wordsection"/>
may pour into me his light unshadowed,<br class="wordsection"/>
that I may sing this candle’s perfect praises).</p>

<p class="calibre6">[The Lord be with you.</p>

<p class="response">And with your spirit.]</p>

<p class="calibre6">Lift up your hearts.</p>

<p class="response">We lift them up to the Lord.</p>

<p class="calibre6">Let us give thanks to the Lord our God.</p>

<p class="response">It is right and just.</p>

<p class="calibre6">It is truly right and just,<br class="wordsection"/>
with ardent love of mind and heart<br class="wordsection"/>
and with devoted service of our voice,<br class="wordsection"/>
to acclaim our God invisible, the almighty Father,<br class="wordsection"/>
and Jesus Christ, our Lord, his Son, his Only Begotten.</p>

<p class="calibre6">Who for our sake paid Adam’s debt to the
eternal Father, <br class="wordsection"/>
and, pouring out his own dear Blood,<br class="wordsection"/>
wiped clean the record of our ancient sinfulness.<br class="wordsection"/>
These, then, are the feasts of Passover,<br class="wordsection"/>
in which is slain the Lamb, the one true Lamb, <br class="wordsection"/>
whose Blood anoints the doorposts of believers.</p>

<p class="calibre6">This is the night,<br class="wordsection"/>
when once you led our forebears, Israel’s children, <br class="wordsection"/>
from slavery in Egypt<br class="wordsection"/>
and made them pass dry-shod through the Red Sea.</p>

<p class="calibre6">This is the night<br class="wordsection"/>
that with a pillar of fire<br class="wordsection"/>
banished the darkness of sin.</p>

<p class="calibre6">This is the night<br class="wordsection"/>
that even now, throughout the world,<br class="wordsection"/>
sets Christian believers apart from worldly vices <br class="wordsection"/>
and from the gloom of sin,<br class="wordsection"/>
leading them to grace<br class="wordsection"/>
and joining them to his holy ones.</p>

<p class="calibre6">This is the night,<br class="wordsection"/>
when Christ broke the prison-bars of death <br class="wordsection"/>
and rose victorious from the underworld.<br class="wordsection"/>
Our birth would have been no gain,<br class="wordsection"/>
had we not been redeemed.</p>

<p class="calibre6">O wonder of your humble care for us! <br class="wordsection"/>
O love, O charity beyond all telling,<br class="wordsection"/>
to ransom a slave you gave away your Son!<br class="wordsection"/>
O truly necessary sin of Adam,<br class="wordsection"/>
destroyed completely by the Death of Christ!</p>

<p class="calibre6">O happy fault<br class="wordsection"/>
that earned so great, so glorious a Redeemer!<br class="wordsection"/>
O truly blessed night,<br class="wordsection"/>
worthy alone to know the time and hour <br class="wordsection"/>
when Christ rose from the underworld!</p>

<p class="calibre6">This is the night<br class="wordsection"/>
of which it is written:<br class="wordsection"/>
The night shall be as bright as day, <br class="wordsection"/>
dazzling is the night for me,<br class="wordsection"/>
and full of gladness.</p>

<p class="calibre6">The sanctifying power of this night<br class="wordsection"/>
dispels wickedness, washes faults away,<br class="wordsection"/>
restores innocence to the fallen, and joy to mourners,<br class="wordsection"/>
drives out hatred, fosters concord, <br class="wordsection"/>
and brings down the mighty.</p>

<p class="calibre6">On this, your night of grace, O holy Father, <br class="wordsection"/>
accept this candle, a solemn offering,<br class="wordsection"/>
the work of bees and of your servants’ hands, <br class="wordsection"/>
an evening sacrifice of praise,<br class="wordsection"/>
this gift from your most holy Church.<br class="wordsection"/>
But now we know the praises of this pillar,<br class="wordsection"/>
which glowing fire ignites for God’s honour,<br class="wordsection"/>
a fire into many flames divided,<br class="wordsection"/>
yet never dimmed by sharing of its light,<br class="wordsection"/>
for it is fed by melting wax, <br class="wordsection"/>
drawn out by mother bees to build a torch so precious.</p>

<p class="calibre6">O truly blessed night,<br class="wordsection"/>
when things of heaven are wed to those of earth, <br class="wordsection"/>
and divine to the human.</p>

<p class="calibre6">Therefore, O Lord,<br class="wordsection"/>
we pray you that this candle,<br class="wordsection"/>
hallowed to the honour of your name, <br class="wordsection"/>
may persevere undimmed,<br class="wordsection"/>
to overcome the darkness of this night. </p>

<p class="calibre6">Receive it as a pleasing fragrance,<br class="wordsection"/>
and let it mingle with the lights of heaven. <br class="wordsection"/>
May this flame be found still burning<br class="wordsection"/>
by the Morning Star:<br class="wordsection"/>
the one Morning Star who never sets, Christ your Son,<br class="wordsection"/>
who, coming back from death’s domain, <br class="wordsection"/>
has shed his peaceful light on humanity, <br class="wordsection"/>
and lives and reigns for ever and ever. </p>

<p class="response">Amen.</p>
