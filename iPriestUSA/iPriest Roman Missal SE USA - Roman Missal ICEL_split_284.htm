ORDINARY TIME </h2>

<h3 class="calibre2">The mystery of salvation</h3>

<p class="rubric">53. The following Preface is
said on Sundays in Ordinary Time. </p>

<p class="calibre6">The Lord be with you.</p>

<p class="response">And with your spirit.</p>

<p class="calibre6">Lift up your hearts.</p>

<p class="response">We lift them up to the Lord.</p>

<p class="calibre6">Let us give thanks to the Lord our God.</p>

<p class="response">It is right and just.</p>

<p class="calibre6">It is truly right and just, our duty and our
salvation, always and everywhere to give you thanks, Lord, holy Father,
almighty and eternal God, through Christ our Lord. </p>

<p class="calibre6">For out of compassion for the waywardness
that is ours, he humbled himself and was born of the Virgin; by the passion of the Cross he freed us from unending death, and by rising from the dead he gave
us life eternal. </p>

<p class="calibre6">And so, with Angels and Archangels, with
Thrones and Dominions, and with all the hosts and Powers of heaven, we sing the
hymn of your glory, as without end we acclaim: </p>

<p class="all">Holy, Holy, Holy Lord God of hosts.
Heaven and earth are full of your glory. Hosanna in the highest. Blessed is he
who comes in the name of the Lord. Hosanna in the highest.</p>
