PASSION OF THE LORD</h2>

<p class="rubric">On this day the Church recalls the entrance of Christ the Lord
into Jerusalem to accomplish his Paschal Mystery. Accordingly, the memorial of this entrance of the Lord takes place at all Masses, by means of the Procession
or the Solemn Entrance before the principal Mass or the Simple Entrance before
other Masses. The Solemn Entrance, but not the Procession, may be repeated
before other Masses that are usually celebrated with a large gathering of people.<br class="wordsection"/>
It is desirable that, where neither the Procession nor the Solemn Entrance can
take place, there be a sacred celebration of the Word of God on the messianic
entrance and on the Passion of the Lord, either on Saturday evening or on
Sunday at a convenient time.</p>
