<p class="calibre6">The Lord be with you.</p>

<p class="response">And with your spirit.</p>

<p class="calibre6">Lift up your hearts.</p>

<p class="response">We lift them up to the Lord.</p>

<p class="calibre6">Let us give thanks to the Lord our God.</p>

<p class="response">It is right and just.</p>

<p class="calibre6">It is truly right and just, our duty and our
salvation, always and everywhere to give you thanks, Lord, holy Father,
almighty and eternal God, through Christ our Lord. </p>

<p class="calibre6">For at the Last Supper with his Apostles, establishing for the ages to come the saving memorial of the Cross, 
he offered himself to you as the unblemished Lamb, the acceptable gift of perfect praise. </p>

<p class="calibre6">Nourishing your faithful by this sacred mystery, 
you make them holy, so that the human race, bounded by one world, 
may be enlightened by one faith and united by one bond of charity. </p>

<p class="calibre6">And so, we approach the table of this wondrous Sacrament, 
so that, bathed in the sweetness of your grace, we may pass over to the heavenly realities here foreshadowed. </p>

<p class="calibre6">Therefore, all creatures of heaven and earth sing a new song in adoration, 
and we, with all the host of Angels, cry out, and without end we acclaim: </p>

<p class="all">Holy, Holy, Holy Lord God of hosts.
Heaven and earth are full of your glory. Hosanna in the highest. Blessed is he
who comes in the name of the Lord. Hosanna in the highest.</p>

<p class="anth">Communion Antiphon | Jn 6: 57</p>

<p class="ant">Whoever eats my flesh and drinks my
blood remains in me and I in him, says the Lord.</p>

<h3 class="calibre2">Prayer after Communion </h3>

<p class="calibre6">Grant, O Lord, we pray,<br class="wordsection"/>
that we may delight for all eternity <br class="wordsection"/>
in that share in your divine life,<br class="wordsection"/>
which is foreshadowed in the present age<br class="wordsection"/>
by our reception of your precious Body and Blood. </p>

<p class="calibre6">Who live and reign for ever and ever.</p>

<p class="rubric">It is desirable that a procession take place after the Mass in which the Host to be carried in the
procession is consecrated. However, nothing prohibits a procession from taking place even after a public and lengthy period of adoration following the Mass. If a procession takes place after Mass, when the Communion of the faithful is over, the monstrance in which the consecrated host has been placed is set on the altar. When the Prayer after Communion has been said, the Concluding Rites are omitted and the procession forms.</p>
