for the Dead</h2>

<h5 class="calibre31">I. Masses and Prayers for Various Needs and Occasions</h5>

<p class="girm">368. Since the liturgy of the Sacraments and Sacramentals has as
its effect that for the faithful who are properly disposed almost every event
in life is sanctified by the divine grace that flows from the Paschal Mystery,<a href="iPriest%20Roman%20Missal%20SE%20USA%20-%20Roman%20Missal%20ICEL_split_884.htm#fn-143"> [143]</a><a id="fn-143-bl"></a> and because the Eucharist is
the Sacrament of Sacraments, the Missal provides examples of Mass formularies
and orations that may be used in the various occasions of Christian life for
the needs of the whole world or for the needs of the Church, whether universal
or local.</p>

<p class="girm">369. In view of the rather broad possibilities of choice among
the readings and orations, it is desirable that Masses for Various Needs and
Occasions be used in moderation, that is, when truly required.</p>

<p class="girm">370. In all the Masses for Various Needs and Occasions, unless
expressly indicated otherwise, it is permissible to use the weekday readings
and also the chants between them, if they are suited to the celebration.</p>

<p class="girm">371. Among Masses of this kind are included Ritual Masses, Masses
for Various Needs and Occasions, and Votive Masses.</p>

<p class="girm">372. Ritual Masses are connected to the celebration of certain
Sacraments or Sacramentals. They are prohibited on Sundays of Advent, Lent, and
Easter, on Solemnities, on the days within the Octave of Easter, on the
Commemoration of All the Faithful Departed (All Souls’ Day), on Ash Wednesday,
and during Holy Week, and furthermore due regard is to be had for the norms set
out in the ritual books or in the Masses themselves.</p>

<p class="girm">373. Masses for Various Needs and Occasions are used in certain
situations either as occasion arises or at fixed times.</p>

<p class="girm">Days or periods of prayer for the fruits of the earth, prayer for
human rights and equality, prayer for world justice and peace, and penitential
observances outside Lent are to be observed in the Dioceses of the United
States of America at times to be designated by the Diocesan Bishop.</p>

<p class="girm">In all the Dioceses of the United States of America, January 22
(or January 23, when January 22 falls on a Sunday) shall be observed as a
particular day of prayer for the full restoration of the legal guarantee of the
right to life and of penance for violations to the dignity of the human person
committed through acts of abortion. The liturgical celebrations for this day
may be the Mass “For Giving Thanks to God for the Gift of Human Life” (no. 48/1
of the Masses and Prayers for Various Needs and Occasions), celebrated with
white vestments, or the Mass “For the Preservation of Peace and Justice” (no.
30 of the Masses and Prayers for Various Needs and Occasions), cele-brated with
violet vestments.</p>

<p class="girm">374. If any case of a graver need or of pastoral advantage should
arise, at the direction of the Diocesan Bishop or with his permission, an
appropriate Mass may be celebrated on any day except Solemnities, the Sundays
of Advent, Lent, and Easter, days within the Octave of Easter, the
Commemoration of All the Faithful Departed (All Souls’ Day), Ash Wednesday, and
the days of Holy Week.</p>

<p class="girm">375. Votive Masses of the mysteries of the Lord or in honour of
the Blessed Virgin Mary or of the Angels or of any given Saint or of all the
Saints may be said in response to the devotion of the faithful on weekdays in
Ordinary Time, even if an Optional Memorial occurs. However, it is not
permitted to celebrate as Votive Masses those that refer to mysteries related
to events in the life of the Lord or of the Blessed Virgin Mary, with the exception
of the Mass of the Immaculate Conception, since their celebration is an
integral part of the course of the liturgical year.</p>

<p class="girm">376. On days when there occurs an Obligatory Memorial or on a
weekday of Advent up to and including December 16, of Christmas Time from
January 2, and of Easter Time after the Octave of Easter, Masses for Various
Needs and Occasions and Votive Masses are in principle forbidden. If, however,
some real necessity or pastoral advantage calls for it, in the estimation of
the rector of the church or the Priest Celebrant himself, a Mass appropriate to
the same may be used in a celebration with the people.</p>

<p class="girm">377. On weekdays in Ordinary Time when an Optional Memorial
occurs or when the Office is of the weekday, it is permissible to celebrate any
Mass for Various Needs and Occasions, or use any prayer for the same, but to
the exclusion of Ritual Masses.</p>

<p class="girm">378. Particularly recommended is the Saturday commemoration of
the Blessed Virgin Mary, because it is to the Mother of the Redeemer that in
the Liturgy of the Church firstly and before all the Saints veneration is
given.<a href="iPriest%20Roman%20Missal%20SE%20USA%20-%20Roman%20Missal%20ICEL_split_884.htm#fn-144"> [144]</a><a id="fn-144-bl"></a></p>

<h5 class="calibre31">II. Masses for the Dead</h5>

<p class="girm">379. The Church offers the Eucharistic Sacrifice of Christ’s
Pasch for the dead so that, since all the members of Christ’s Body are in
communion with one another, what implores spiritual help for some, may bring
comforting hope to others.</p>

<p class="girm">380. Among the Masses for the Dead, the Funeral Mass holds first
place. It may be celebrated on any day except for Solemnities that are Holydays
of Obligation, Thursday of Holy Week (Holy Thursday), the Paschal Triduum, and
the Sundays of Advent, Lent, and Easter, with due regard also for all the other
requirements of the norm of the law.<a href="iPriest%20Roman%20Missal%20SE%20USA%20-%20Roman%20Missal%20ICEL_split_884.htm#fn-145"> [145]</a><a id="fn-145-bl"></a></p>

<p class="girm">381. A Mass for the Dead, on receiving the news of a death, for
the final burial, or the first anniversary, may be celebrated even on days
within the Octave of the Nativity of the Lord (Christmas), on days when an
Obligatory Memorial occurs, and on weekdays other than Ash Wednesday or the
weekdays of Holy Week.</p>

<p class="girm">Other Masses for the Dead or “daily” Masses, may be celebrated on
weekdays in Ordinary Time on which Optional Memorials occur or when the Office
is of the weekday, provided such Masses are actually applied for the dead.</p>

<p class="girm">382. At Funeral Masses there should usually be a short Homily,
but to the exclusion of a funeral eulogy of any kind.</p>

<p class="girm">383. The faithful, and especially those of the deceased’s family,
should be urged to participate in the Eucharistic Sacrifice offered for the
deceased person, also by receiving Holy Communion.</p>

<p class="girm">384. If the Funeral Mass is directly joined to the rite of
burial, once the Prayer after Communion has been said and omitting the
Concluding Rites, there takes place the Rite of Final Commendation or Farewell.
This rite is celebrated only if the body is present.</p>

<p class="girm">385. In the arranging and choosing of the variable parts of the
Mass for the Dead, especially the Funeral Mass (for example, orations,
readings, and the Universal Prayer), pastoral considerations bearing upon the
deceased, the family, and those attending should be kept in mind.</p>

<p class="girm">Moreover, pastors should take into special account those who are
present at a liturgical celebration or who hear the Gospel on the occasion of
the funeral and who may be non-Catholics or Catholics who never or hardly ever
participate in the Eucharist or who seem even to have lost the faith. For
Priests are ministers of Christ’s Gospel for all.</p>
