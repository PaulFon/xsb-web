<h3 class="calibre2">Christ the Light</h3>

<p class="rubric">35. The following Preface is
said in Masses of the Nativity of the Lord and of its Octave Day, and within
the Octave, even in Masses that otherwise might have a proper Preface, with the
exception of Masses that have a proper Preface concerning the divine mysteries
or divine Persons. It is also used on weekdays of Christmas Time. </p>

<p class="calibre6">The Lord be with you.</p>

<p class="response">And with your spirit.</p>

<p class="calibre6">Lift up your hearts.</p>

<p class="response">We lift them up to the Lord.</p>

<p class="calibre6">Let us give thanks to the Lord our God.</p>

<p class="response">It is right and just.</p>

<p class="calibre6">It is truly right and just, our duty and our
salvation, always and everywhere to give you thanks, Lord, holy Father,
almighty and eternal God. </p>

<p class="calibre6">For in the mystery of the Word made flesh a
new light of your glory has shone upon the eyes of our mind, so that, as we
recognise in him God made visible, we may be caught up through him in love of things invisible. </p>

<p class="calibre6">And so, with Angels and Archangels, with
Thrones and Dominions, and with all the hosts and Powers of heaven, we sing the
hymn of your glory, as without end we acclaim: </p>

<p class="all">Holy, Holy, Holy Lord God of hosts.
Heaven and earth are full of your glory. Hosanna in the highest. Blessed is he
who comes in the name of the Lord. Hosanna in the highest.</p>
