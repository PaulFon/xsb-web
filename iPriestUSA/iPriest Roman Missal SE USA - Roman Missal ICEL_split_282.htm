<h3 class="calibre2">The mystery of the Ascension</h3>

<p class="rubric">51. The following Preface is
said on the day of the Ascension of the Lord. It may be said on the days between
the Ascension and Pentecost in all Masses that have no proper Preface. </p>

<p class="calibre6">The Lord be with you.</p>

<p class="response">And with your spirit.</p>

<p class="calibre6">Lift up your hearts.</p>

<p class="response">We lift them up to the Lord.</p>

<p class="calibre6">Let us give thanks to the Lord our God.</p>

<p class="response">It is right and just.</p>

<p class="calibre6">It is truly right and just, our duty and our
salvation, always and everywhere to give you thanks, Lord, holy Father,
almighty and eternal God, through Christ our Lord. </p>

<p class="calibre6">For after his Resurrection he plainly appeared
to all his disciples and was taken up to heaven in their sight, that he might
make us sharers in his divinity. </p>

<p class="calibre6">Therefore, overcome with paschal joy, every
land, every people exults in your praise and even the heavenly Powers, with the
angelic hosts, sing together the unending hymn of your glory, as they acclaim: </p>

<p class="all">Holy, Holy, Holy Lord God of hosts.
Heaven and earth are full of your glory. Hosanna in the highest. Blessed is he
who comes in the name of the Lord. Hosanna in the highest.</p>
