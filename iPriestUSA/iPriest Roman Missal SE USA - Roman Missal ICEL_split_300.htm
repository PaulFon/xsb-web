<h3 class="calibre2">The glory of the Saints</h3>

<p class="rubric">66. The following Preface is
said in Masses of All Saints, of Patron Saints and of Saints who are Titulars of a church, and on Solemnities and Feasts of Saints, unless a proper Preface is
to be said. This Preface may be said also on Memorials of Saints. </p>

<p class="calibre6">The Lord be with you.</p>

<p class="response">And with your spirit.</p>

<p class="calibre6">Lift up your hearts.</p>

<p class="response">We lift them up to the Lord.</p>

<p class="calibre6">Let us give thanks to the Lord our God.</p>

<p class="response">It is right and just.</p>

<p class="calibre6">It is truly right and just, our duty and our
salvation, always and everywhere to give you thanks, Lord, holy Father,
almighty and eternal God. </p>

<p class="calibre6">For you are praised in the company of your
Saints and, in crowning their merits, you crown your own gifts. By their way of life you offer us an example, by communion with them you give us companionship,
by their intercession, sure support, so that, encouraged by so great a cloud of witnesses, we may run as victors in the race before us and win with them the
imperishable crown of glory, through Christ our Lord. </p>

<p class="calibre6">And so, with the Angels and Archangels, and
with the great multitude of the Saints, we sing the hymn of your praise, as
without end we acclaim: </p>

<p class="all">Holy, Holy, Holy Lord God of hosts.
Heaven and earth are full of your glory. Hosanna in the highest. Blessed is he
who comes in the name of the Lord. Hosanna in the highest.</p>
