<h3 class="calibre2">New life in Christ</h3>

<p class="rubric">46. The following Preface is
said during Easter Time. </p>

<p class="calibre6">The Lord be with you.</p>

<p class="response">And with your spirit.</p>

<p class="calibre6">Lift up your hearts.</p>

<p class="response">We lift them up to the Lord.</p>

<p class="calibre6">Let us give thanks to the Lord our God.</p>

<p class="response">It is right and just.</p>

<p class="calibre6">It is truly right and just, our duty and our
salvation, at all times to acclaim you, O Lord, but in this time above all to
laud you yet more gloriously, when Christ our Passover has been sacrificed. </p>

<p class="calibre6">Through him the children of light rise to
eternal life and the halls of the heavenly Kingdom are thrown open to the
faithful; for his Death is our ransom from death, and in his rising the life of all has risen. </p>

<p class="calibre6">Therefore, overcome with paschal joy, every
land, every people exults in your praise and even the heavenly Powers, with the
angelic hosts, sing together the unending hymn of your glory, as they acclaim: </p>

<p class="all">Holy, Holy, Holy Lord God of hosts.
Heaven and earth are full of your glory. Hosanna in the highest. Blessed is he
who comes in the name of the Lord. Hosanna in the highest.</p>
