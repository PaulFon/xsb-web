<p class="calibre6">Sanctify, O Lord, we pray,<br class="wordsection"/>
these offerings here made to celebrate<br class="wordsection"/>
the glorious Transfiguration of your Only Begotten Son, <br class="wordsection"/>

cleanse us from the stains of sin.</p>

<p class="calibre6">Through Christ our Lord.</p>

<p class="calibre6">The Lord be with you.</p>

<p class="response">And with your spirit.</p>

<p class="calibre6">Lift up your hearts.</p>

<p class="response">We lift them up to the Lord.</p>

<p class="calibre6">Let us give thanks to the Lord our God.</p>

<p class="response">It is right and just.</p>

<p class="calibre6">It is truly right and just, our duty and our
salvation, <br class="wordsection"/>
always and everywhere to give you thanks,<br class="wordsection"/>
Lord, holy Father, almighty and eternal God, <br class="wordsection"/>
through Christ our Lord.</p>

<p class="calibre6">For he revealed his glory in the presence of
chosen witnesses <br class="wordsection"/>
and filled with the greatest splendour that bodily form<br class="wordsection"/>
which he shares with all humanity,<br class="wordsection"/>
that the scandal of the Cross<br class="wordsection"/>
might be removed from the hearts of his disciples <br class="wordsection"/>
and that he might show<br class="wordsection"/>
how in the body of the whole Church <br class="wordsection"/>
is to be fulfilled what so wonderfully shone forth first in its Head.</p>

<p class="calibre6">And so, with the Powers of heaven, <br class="wordsection"/>
we worship you constantly on earth, <br class="wordsection"/>
and before your majesty<br class="wordsection"/>
without end we acclaim:</p>

<p class="all">Holy, Holy, Holy Lord God of hosts.
Heaven and earth are full of your glory. Hosanna in the highest. Blessed is he
who comes in the name of the Lord. Hosanna in the highest.</p>
