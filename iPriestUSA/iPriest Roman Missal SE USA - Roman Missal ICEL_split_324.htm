The Priest, with hands extended, says: </p>

<p class="calibre6">To you, therefore, most merciful Father, <br class="wordsection"/>
we make humble prayer and petition through Jesus Christ, <br class="wordsection"/>
your Son, our Lord: </p>

<p class="rubric">He joins his hands and says </p>

<p class="calibre6">that you accept </p>

<p class="rubric">He makes the Sign of the Cross
once over the bread and chalice together, saying: </p>

<p class="calibre6">and bless <span class="red1">+</span> these
gifts, these offerings, <br class="wordsection"/>
these holy and unblemished sacrifices, </p>

<p class="rubric">With hands extended, he
continues: </p>

<p class="calibre6">which we offer you firstly for your holy

together with your servant <span class="red1">N.</span> our Pope and <span class="red1">N.</span> our Bishop,<span class="red1">*</span> <br class="wordsection"/>

Commemoration of the Living. </p>

<p class="calibre6">Remember, Lord, your servants <span class="red1">N.</span> and <span class="red1">N.</span></p>

<p class="rubric">The Priest joins his hands and
prays briefly for those for whom he intends to pray. </p>

<p class="rubric">Then, with hands extended, he
continues: </p>

<p class="calibre6">and all gathered here, <br class="wordsection"/>
whose faith and devotion are known to you. <br class="wordsection"/>
For them, we offer you this sacrifice of praise <br class="wordsection"/>
or they offer it for themselves and all who are dear to them: <br class="wordsection"/>
for the redemption of their souls, <br class="wordsection"/>
in hope of health and well-being, <br class="wordsection"/>
and paying their homage to you, <br class="wordsection"/>
the eternal God, living and true. </p>

<p class="rubric"><img border="0" id="_x0000_i1203" src="c2.gif" class="calibre12"/>86.
Within the Action. On the Nativity of the Lord and throughout the Octave </p>

<p class="calibre6">In communion with those whose memory we

especially the glorious ever-Virgin Mary, <br class="wordsection"/>
Mother of our God and Lord, Jesus Christ, <br class="wordsection"/>
and blessed Joseph, her Spouse, <br class="wordsection"/>
your blessed Apostles and Martyrs, <br class="wordsection"/>

<p class="calibre6">and all your Saints; <br class="wordsection"/>
we ask that through their merits and prayers, <br class="wordsection"/>
in all things we may be defended by your protecting help. </p>

<p class="quietly"><span class="red1">(</span>Through Christ our Lord. Amen.<span class="red1">)</span> </p>

<p class="rubric"><img border="0" id="_x0000_i1202" src="pc.gif" class="calibre12"/>87.
With hands extended, the Priest continues: </p>

<p class="calibre6">Therefore, Lord, we pray:<br class="wordsection"/>
graciously accept this oblation of our service,<br class="wordsection"/>
that of your whole family, which we offer you<br class="wordsection"/>
also for those reborn in Baptism,<br class="wordsection"/>
whom you have been pleased to confirm<br class="wordsection"/>
by bestowing the Holy Spirit:<br class="wordsection"/>
in your mercy, we pray, keep safe in them your grace.</p>

<p class="quietly"><span class="red1">(</span>Through Christ our Lord. Amen.<span class="red1">)</span> </p>

<p class="rubric"><img border="0" id="_x0000_i1201" src="cc.gif" class="calibre12"/>88.
Holding his hands extended over the offerings, he says: </p>

<p class="calibre6">Be pleased, O God, we pray, <br class="wordsection"/>
to bless, acknowledge, and approve this offering in every respect; <br class="wordsection"/>
make it spiritual and acceptable, <br class="wordsection"/>
so that it may become for us <br class="wordsection"/>
the Body and Blood of your most beloved Son, <br class="wordsection"/>
our Lord Jesus Christ. </p>

<p class="rubric">He joins his hands. </p>

<p class="rubric">89. In the formulas that follow,
the words of the Lord should be pronounced clearly and distinctly, as the
nature of these words requires. </p>

<p class="calibre6">On the day before he was to suffer, </p>

<p class="rubric">He takes the bread and, holding
it slightly raised above the altar, continues: </p>

<p class="calibre6">he took bread in his holy and venerable
hands, </p>

<p class="rubric">He raises his eyes. </p>

<p class="calibre6">and with eyes raised to heaven to you, <br class="wordsection"/>
O God, his almighty Father, <br class="wordsection"/>
giving you thanks, <br class="wordsection"/>
he said the blessing, <br class="wordsection"/>
broke the bread and gave it to his disciples, saying: </p>

<p class="rubric">He bows slightly. </p>

<p class="calibre6">TAKE THIS, ALL OF YOU, AND EAT OF IT, <br class="wordsection"/>
FOR THIS IS MY BODY, WHICH WILL BE GIVEN UP FOR YOU.</p>

<p class="rubric">He shows the consecrated host to
the people, places it again on the paten, and genuflects in adoration. </p>

<p class="rubric">90. After this, the Priest
continues: </p>

<p class="calibre6">In a similar way, when supper was ended, </p>

<p class="rubric">He takes the chalice and,
holding it slightly raised above the altar, continues: </p>

<p class="calibre6">he took this precious chalice in his holy and
venerable hands, and once more giving you thanks, he said the blessing and gave
the chalice to his disciples, saying: </p>

<p class="rubric">He bows slightly. </p>

<p class="calibre6">TAKE THIS, ALL OF YOU, AND DRINK FROM IT, <br class="wordsection"/>
FOR THIS IS THE CHALICE OF MY BLOOD, <br class="wordsection"/>
THE BLOOD OF THE NEW AND ETERNAL COVENANT, <br class="wordsection"/>
WHICH WILL BE POURED OUT FOR YOU <br class="wordsection"/>
AND FOR MANY FOR THE FORGIVENESS OF SINS. </p>

<p class="calibre6">DO THIS IN MEMORY OF ME. </p>

<p class="rubric">He shows the chalice to the
people, places it on the corporal, and genuflects in adoration. </p>

<p class="rubric"><img border="0" id="_x0000_i1200" src="pc.gif" class="calibre12"/>91.
Then he says: </p>

<p class="calibre6">The mystery of faith. </p>

<p class="rubric">And the people continue,
acclaiming: </p>

<p class="response">We proclaim your Death, O
Lord, <br class="wordsection"/>
and profess your Resurrection until you come again. </p>

<p class="rubric">or: </p>

<p class="response">When we eat this Bread and
drink this Cup, <br class="wordsection"/>
we proclaim your Death, O Lord, until you come again. </p>

<p class="rubric">or: </p>

<p class="response">Save us, Saviour of the world,
<br class="wordsection"/>
for by your Cross and Resurrection you have set us free. </p>

<p class="rubric"><img border="0" id="_x0000_i1199" src="cc.gif" class="calibre12"/>92.
Then the Priest, with hands extended, says: </p>

<p class="calibre6">Therefore, O Lord, as we celebrate the
memorial of the blessed Passion, the Resurrection from the dead, <br class="wordsection"/>
and the glorious Ascension into heaven of Christ, <br class="wordsection"/>
your Son, our Lord, <br class="wordsection"/>
we, your servants and your holy people, <br class="wordsection"/>
offer to your glorious majesty from the gifts that you have given us, this pure
victim, this holy victim, <br class="wordsection"/>
this spotless victim, <br class="wordsection"/>
the holy Bread of eternal life <br class="wordsection"/>
and the Chalice of everlasting salvation. </p>

<p class="rubric">93. </p>

<p class="calibre6">Be pleased to look upon these offerings <br class="wordsection"/>
with a serene and kindly countenance, <br class="wordsection"/>
and to accept them, <br class="wordsection"/>
as once you were pleased to accept <br class="wordsection"/>
the gifts of your servant Abel the just, <br class="wordsection"/>
the sacrifice of Abraham, our father in faith, <br class="wordsection"/>
and the offering of your high priest Melchizedek, <br class="wordsection"/>
a holy sacrifice, a spotless victim. </p>

<p class="rubric">94. Bowing, with hands joined,
he continues: </p>

<p class="calibre6">In humble prayer we ask you, almighty God: <br class="wordsection"/>
command that these gifts be borne <br class="wordsection"/>
by the hands of your holy Angel <br class="wordsection"/>
to your altar on high in the sight of your divine majesty, <br class="wordsection"/>
so that all of us, <br class="wordsection"/>
who through this participation at the altar <br class="wordsection"/>
receive the most holy Body and Blood of your Son, </p>

<p class="rubric">He stands upright again and
signs himself with the Sign of the Cross, saying: </p>

<p class="calibre6">may be filled with every grace and heavenly
blessing. </p>

<p class="rubric">He joins his hands. </p>

<p class="quietly"><span class="red1">(</span>Through Christ our Lord. Amen.<span class="red1">)</span> </p>

<p class="rubric"><img border="0" id="_x0000_i1198" src="c3.gif" class="calibre12"/>95.
Commemoration of the Dead </p>

<p class="rubric">With hands extended, the Priest
says: </p>

<p class="calibre6">Remember also, Lord, your servants <span class="red1">N.</span> and <span class="red1">N.</span>, <br class="wordsection"/>
who have gone before us with the sign of faith <br class="wordsection"/>
and rest in the sleep of peace. </p>

<p class="rubric">He joins his hands and prays
briefly for those who have died and for whom he intends to pray. </p>

<p class="rubric">Then, with hands extended, he
continues: </p>

<p class="calibre6">Grant them, O Lord, we pray, <br class="wordsection"/>
and all who sleep in Christ, <br class="wordsection"/>
a place of refreshment, light and peace. </p>

<p class="rubric">He joins his hands. </p>

<p class="quietly"><span class="red1">(</span>Through Christ our Lord. Amen.<span class="red1">)</span> </p>

<p class="rubric"><img border="0" id="_x0000_i1197" src="c4.gif" class="calibre12"/>96.
He strikes his breast with his right hand, saying: </p>

<p class="calibre6">To us, also, your servants, who, though sinners,
</p>

<p class="rubric">And, with hands extended, he
continues: </p>

<p class="calibre6">hope in your abundant mercies, <br class="wordsection"/>
graciously grant some share and fellowship <br class="wordsection"/>
with your holy Apostles and Martyrs: <br class="wordsection"/>
with John the Baptist, Stephen, Matthias, Barnabas, </p>

<p class="quietly"><span class="red1">(</span>Ignatius,
Alexander, Marcellinus, Peter, <br class="wordsection"/>
Felicity, Perpetua, Agatha, <br class="wordsection"/>
Lucy, Agnes, Cecilia, Anastasia<span class="red1">)</span> </p>

<p class="calibre6">and all your Saints; admit us, <br class="wordsection"/>
we beseech you, into their company, <br class="wordsection"/>
not weighing our merits, but granting us your pardon, </p>

<p class="rubric">He joins his hands. </p>

<p class="calibre6">through Christ our Lord. </p>

<p class="rubric"><img border="0" id="_x0000_i1196" src="pc.gif" class="calibre12"/>97.
And he continues: </p>

<p class="calibre6">Through whom you continue to make <br class="wordsection"/>
all these good things, O Lord; <br class="wordsection"/>
you sanctify them, fill them with life, <br class="wordsection"/>
bless them, and bestow them upon us. </p>

<p class="rubric"><img border="0" id="_x0000_i1195" src="pcc.gif" class="calibre12"/>98.
He takes the chalice and the paten with the host and, raising both, he says: </p>

<p class="calibre6">Through him, and with him, and in him, <br class="wordsection"/>
O God, almighty Father, <br class="wordsection"/>
in the unity of the Holy Spirit, <br class="wordsection"/>
all glory and honour is yours, <br class="wordsection"/>
for ever and ever.</p>

<p class="rubric">The people acclaim: </p>

<p class="response">Amen. | <a href="iPriest%20Roman%20Missal%20SE%20USA%20-%20Roman%20Missal%20ICEL_split_347.htm#CR">Then follows the Communion Rite.</a></p>
