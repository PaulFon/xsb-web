VIRGIN MARY </h2>

<h3 class="calibre2">The Church praises God with the words of Mary</h3>

<p class="rubric">63. The following Preface is
said in Masses of the Blessed Virgin Mary. </p>

<p class="calibre6">The Lord be with you.</p>

<p class="response">And with your spirit.</p>

<p class="calibre6">Lift up your hearts.</p>

<p class="response">We lift them up to the Lord.</p>

<p class="calibre6">Let us give thanks to the Lord our God.</p>

<p class="response">It is right and just.</p>

<p class="calibre6">It is truly right and just, our duty and our
salvation, to praise your mighty deeds in the exaltation of all the Saints, and
especially, as we celebrate the memory of the Blessed Virgin Mary, to proclaim
your kindness as we echo her thankful hymn of praise. </p>

<p class="calibre6">For truly even to earth’s ends you have done
great things and extended your abundant mercy from age to age: when you looked
on the lowliness of your handmaid, you gave us through her the author of our
salvation, your Son, Jesus Christ, our Lord. </p>

<p class="calibre6">Through him the host of Angels adores your
majesty and rejoices in your presence for ever. May our voices, we pray, join
with theirs in one chorus of exultant praise, as we acclaim: </p>

<p class="all">Holy, Holy, Holy Lord God of hosts.
Heaven and earth are full of your glory. Hosanna in the highest. Blessed is he
who comes in the name of the Lord. Hosanna in the highest.</p>
