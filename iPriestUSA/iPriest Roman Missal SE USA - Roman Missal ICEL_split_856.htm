<p class="calibre6">In this time of the Lord’s Passion,<br class="wordsection"/>
when Christ offered prayers and supplications to his Father <br class="wordsection"/>
with loud cries and tears,<br class="wordsection"/>
let us humbly beseech God,<br class="wordsection"/>
that in answer to his Son’s reverent submission<br class="wordsection"/>
he may in mercy hear our prayers also.</p>

<h3 class="calibre2">Intentions</h3>

may be more fully cleansed by his Blood in this time of his Passion,<br class="wordsection"/>
let us pray to the Lord.</p>

all things in the world<br class="wordsection"/>
may be brought to peace for the sake of salvation, let us pray to the Lord.</p>

to all who through sickness or hardship have a share in Christ’s Passion,<br class="wordsection"/>

<h3 class="calibre2">Priest’s Prayer</h3>

Who lives and reigns for ever and ever.</p>
