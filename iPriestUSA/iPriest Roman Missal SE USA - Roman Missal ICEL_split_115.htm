THE ADORATION OF THE HOLY CROSS</h2>

<p class="rubric">After the Solemn Intercessions,
the solemn Adoration of the Holy Cross takes place. Of the two forms of the
showing of the Cross presented here, the more appropriate one, according to
pastoral needs, should be chosen.</p>

<h3 class="calibre2">The Showing of the Holy Cross<br class="calibre4"/>
First Form</h3>

<p class="rubric">The Deacon accompanied by
ministers, or another suitable minister, goes to the sacristy, from which, in
procession, accompanied by two ministers with lighted candles, he carries the
Cross, covered with a violet veil, through the church to the middle of the
sanctuary.</p>

<p class="rubric">The Priest, standing before the
altar and facing the people, receives the Cross, uncovers a little of its upper
part and elevates it while beginning the Ecce lignum Crucis (Behold the wood of the Cross). He is assisted in singing by the Deacon or, if need be, by the
choir. All respond, Come, let us adore. At the end of the singing, all kneel
and for a brief moment adore in silence, while the Priest stands and holds the
Cross raised.</p>

<p class="calibre6">Behold the wood of the Cross,<br class="wordsection"/>
on which hung the salvation of the world.</p>

<p class="response">Come, let us adore.</p>

<p class="rubric">Then the Priest uncovers the
right arm of the Cross and again, raising up the Cross, begins, Behold the wood
of the Cross and everything takes place as above.<br class="wordsection"/>
Finally, he uncovers the Cross entirely and, raising it up, he begins the
invitation Behold the wood of the Cross a third time and everything takes place
like the first time.</p>

<h3 class="calibre2">Second Form</h3>

<p class="rubric">The Priest or the Deacon
accompanied by ministers, or another suitable minister, goes to the door of the
church, where he receives the unveiled Cross, and the ministers take lighted
candles; then the procession sets off through the church to the sanctuary. Near
the door, in the middle of the church and before the entrance of the sanctuary,
the one who carries the Cross elevates it, singing, Behold the wood of the
Cross, to which all respond, Come, let us adore. After each response all kneel
and for a brief moment adore in silence, as above.</p>

<h3 class="calibre2">The Adoration of the Holy Cross</h3>

<p class="rubric">Then, accompanied by two
ministers with lighted candles, the Priest or the Deacon carries the Cross to
the entrance of the sanctuary or to another suitable place and there puts it
down or hands it over to the ministers to hold. Candles are placed on the right
and left sides of the Cross.</p>

<p class="rubric">For the Adoration of the Cross,
first the Priest Celebrant alone approaches, with the chasuble and his shoes
removed, if appropriate. Then the clergy, the lay ministers, and the faithful
approach, moving as if in procession, and showing reverence to the Cross by a
simple genuflection or by some other sign appropriate to the usage of the
region, for example, by kissing the Cross.</p>

<p class="rubric">Only one Cross should be offered
for adoration. If, because of the large number of people, it is not possible
for all to approach individually, the Priest, after some of the clergy and
faithful have adored, takes the Cross and, standing in the middle before the
altar, invites the people in a few words to adore the Holy Cross and afterwards
holds the Cross elevated higher for a brief time, for the faithful to adore it
in silence.</p>

<p class="rubric">While the adoration of the Holy
Cross is taking place, the antiphon Crucem tuam adoramus (We adore your Cross,
O Lord), the Reproaches, the hymn Crux fidelis (Faithful Cross) or other
suitable chants are sung, during which all who have already adored the Cross
remain seated.</p>

<p class="calibre6"><a href="iPriest%20Roman%20Missal%20SE%20USA%20-%20Roman%20Missal%20ICEL_split_116.htm#t23">Third Part</a> </p>

<h3 class="calibre2">Chants to Be Sung during the Adoration of the Holy Cross</h3>

<p class="calibre6">Ant. We adore your Cross, O Lord,<br class="wordsection"/>
we praise and glorify your holy Resurrection, <br class="wordsection"/>
for behold, because of the wood of a tree<br class="wordsection"/>
joy has come to the whole world.</p>

<p class="rubric">Cf. Ps 67 (66): 2</p>

<p class="calibre6">May God have mercy on us and bless us;<br class="wordsection"/>
may he let his face shed its light upon us<br class="wordsection"/>
and have mercy on us.</p>

<p class="rubric">And the antiphon is repeated: We
adore ...</p>

<h3 class="calibre2">The Reproaches</h3>

<p class="rubric">Parts assigned to one of the two
choirs separately are indicated by the numbers 1 (first choir) and 2 (second
choir); parts sung by both choirs together are marked: 1 and 2. Some of the
verses may also be sung by two cantors.</p>

<p class="anth">I</p>

<p class="calibre6">1 and 2 My people, what have I done to you?<br class="wordsection"/>
Or how have I grieved you? Answer me!</p>

<p class="calibre6">1 and 2 What more should I have done for you
and have not done? <br class="wordsection"/>
Indeed, I planted you as my most beautiful chosen vine<br class="wordsection"/>
and you have turned very bitter for me,<br class="wordsection"/>
for in my thirst you gave me vinegar to drink<br class="wordsection"/>
and with a lance you pierced your Saviour’s side.</p>

2 Holy is God,<br class="wordsection"/>

For, when Adam first offended, <br class="wordsection"/>
Eating that forbidden fruit,<br class="wordsection"/>

With the serpent at the root: <br class="wordsection"/>
Broken nature would be mended <br class="wordsection"/>
By a second tree and shoot.</p>

Earth and stars and oceantide.</p>
