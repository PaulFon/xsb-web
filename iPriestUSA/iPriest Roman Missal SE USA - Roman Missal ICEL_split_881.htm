<h5 class="calibre31">I. The Bread and Wine for Celebrating the Eucharist</h5>

<p class="girm">319. Following the example of Christ, the Church has always used
bread and wine with water to celebrate the Lord’s Supper.</p>

<p class="girm">320. The bread for celebrating the Eucharist must be made only
from wheat, must be recently made, and, according to the ancient tradition of
the Latin Church, must be unleavened.</p>

<p class="girm">321. By reason of the sign, it is required that the material for
the Eucharistic Celebration truly have the appearance of food. Therefore, it is
desirable that the Eucharistic Bread, even though unleavened and made in the
traditional form, be fashioned in such a way that the Priest at Mass with the
people is truly able to break it into parts and distribute these to at least
some of the faithful. However, small hosts are not at all excluded when the
large number of those receiving Holy Communion or other pastoral reasons call
for them. Moreover, the gesture of the fraction or breaking of bread, which was
quite simply the term by which the Eucharist was known in apostolic times, will
bring out more clearly the force and importance of the sign of the unity of all
in the one bread, and of the sign of charity by the fact that the one bread is
distributed among the brothers and sisters.</p>

<p class="girm">322. The wine for the celebration of the Eucharist must be from
the fruit of the vine (cf. Lk 22:18), natural, and unadulterated, that is,
without admixture of extraneous substances.</p>

<p class="girm">323. Diligent care should be taken to ensure that the bread and
wine intended for the Eucharist are kept in a perfect state of conservation:
that is, that the wine does not turn to vinegar nor the bread spoil or become
too hard to be broken easily.</p>

<p class="girm">324. If after the Consecration or as he receives Communion, the
Priest notices that not wine but only water was poured into the chalice, he
pours the water into some container, pours wine with water into the chalice and
consecrates it, saying the part of narrative relating to the Consecration of
the chalice, without being obliged to consecrate the bread again.</p>

<h5 class="calibre31">II. Sacred Furnishings in General</h5>

<p class="girm">325. As in the case of the building of churches, so also
regarding all sacred furnishings, the Church admits the manner of art of each
individual region and accepts those adaptations that are in keeping with the
culture and traditions of the individual nations, provided that all are suited
to the purpose for which the sacred furnishings are intended.<a href="iPriest%20Roman%20Missal%20SE%20USA%20-%20Roman%20Missal%20ICEL_split_884.htm#fn-134">
[134]</a><a id="fn-134-bl"></a></p>

<p class="girm">In this matter as well, that noble simplicity should be ensured which
is the best accompaniment of genuine art.</p>

<p class="girm">326. In choosing materials for sacred furnishings, besides those
which are traditional, others are admissible that, according to the mentality
of our own age, are considered to be noble and are durable, and well suited for
sacred use. In the Dioceses of the United States of America these materials may
include wood, stone, or metal which are solid and appropriate to the purpose
for which they are employed.</p>

<h5 class="calibre31">III. Sacred Vessels</h5>

<p class="girm">327. Among the requisites for the celebration of Mass, the sacred
vessels are held in special honour, and among these especially the chalice and
paten, in which the bread and wine are offered and consecrated and from which
they are consumed.</p>

<p class="girm">328. Sacred vessels should be made from precious metal. If they
are made from metal that rusts or from a metal less precious than gold, they
should generally be gilded on the inside.</p>

<p class="girm">329. In the Dioceses of the United States of America, sacred
vessels may also be made from other solid materials which in the common
estimation in each region are considered precious or noble, for example, ebony
or other harder woods, provided that such materials are suitable for sacred
use. In this case, preference is always to be given to materials that do not
easily break or deteriorate. This applies to all vessels that are intended to
hold the hosts, such as the paten, the ciborium, the pyx, the monstrance, and
others of this kind.</p>

<p class="girm">330. As regards chalices and other vessels that are intended to
serve as receptacles for the Blood of the Lord, they are to have a bowl of
material that does not absorb liquids. The base, on the other hand, may be made
of other solid and worthy materials.</p>

<p class="girm">331. For the Consecration of hosts, a large paten may fittingly
be used, on which is placed the bread both for the Priest and the Deacon and
also for the other ministers and for the faithful.</p>

<p class="girm">332. As regards the form of the sacred vessels, it is for the
artist to fashion them in a manner that is more particularly in keeping with
the customs of each region, provided the individual vessels are suitable for
their intended liturgical use and are clearly distinguishable from vessels
intended for everyday use.</p>

<p class="girm">333. As for the blessing of sacred vessels, the rites prescribed
in the liturgical books should be followed.<a href="iPriest%20Roman%20Missal%20SE%20USA%20-%20Roman%20Missal%20ICEL_split_884.htm#fn-135"> [135]</a><a id="fn-135-bl"></a></p>

<p class="girm">334. The practice should be kept of building in the sacristy a
sacrarium into which is poured the water from the washing of sacred vessels and
linens (cf. no. 280).</p>

<h5 class="calibre31">IV. Sacred Vestments</h5>

<p class="girm">335. In the Church, which is the Body of Christ, not all members
have the same function. This diversity of offices is shown outwardly in the
celebration of the Eucharist by the diversity of sacred vestments, which must
therefore be a sign of the function proper to each minister. Moreover, these
same sacred vestments should also contribute to the decoration of the sacred
action itself. The vestments worn by Priests and Deacons, as well as the attire
worn by lay ministers, are blessed before being put into liturgical use according
to the rite described in the Roman Ritual.<a href="iPriest%20Roman%20Missal%20SE%20USA%20-%20Roman%20Missal%20ICEL_split_884.htm#fn-136"> [136]</a><a id="fn-136-bl"></a></p>

<p class="girm">336. The sacred garment common to all ordained and instituted
ministers of any rank is the alb, to be tied at the waist with a cincture
unless it is made so as to fit even without such. Before the alb is put on,
should this not completely cover the ordinary clothing at the neck, an amice
should be used. The alb may not be exchanged for a surplice, not even over a
cassock, on occasions when a chasuble or dalmatic is to be worn or when,
according to the norms, only a stole is worn without a chasuble or dalmatic.</p>

<p class="girm">337. The vestment proper to the Priest Celebrant at Mass and
during other sacred actions directly connected with Mass is the chasuble worn,
unless otherwise indicated, over the alb and stole.</p>

<p class="girm">338. The vestment proper to the Deacon is the dalmatic, worn over
the alb and stole; however, the dalmatic may be omitted out of necessity or on
account of a lesser degree of solemnity.</p>

<p class="girm">339. In the Dioceses of the United States of America, acolytes,
altar servers, readers, and other lay ministers may wear the alb or other
appropriate and dignified clothing.</p>

<p class="girm">340. The stole is worn by the Priest around his neck and hanging
down in front of his chest, while it is worn by the Deacon over his left
shoulder and drawn diagonally across the chest to the right side, where it is
fastened.</p>

<p class="girm">341. The cope is worn by the Priest in processions and during
other sacred actions, in accordance with the rubrics proper to the individual
rites.</p>

<p class="girm">342. As regards the form of sacred vestments, Conferences of
Bishops may determine and propose to the Apostolic See adaptations that
correspond to the needs and the usages of the individual regions.<a href="iPriest%20Roman%20Missal%20SE%20USA%20-%20Roman%20Missal%20ICEL_split_884.htm#fn-137"> [137]</a><a id="fn-137-bl"></a></p>

<p class="girm">343. For making sacred vestments, in addition to traditional
materials, natural fabrics proper to each region may be used, and also
artificial fabrics that are in keeping with the dignity of the sacred action
and the sacred person. The Conference of Bishops will be the judge of this
matter.<a href="iPriest%20Roman%20Missal%20SE%20USA%20-%20Roman%20Missal%20ICEL_split_884.htm#fn-138"> [138]</a><a id="fn-138-bl"></a></p>

<p class="girm">344. It is fitting that the beauty and nobility of each vestment
not be sought in an abundance of overlaid ornamentation, but rather in the
material used and in the design. Ornamentation on vestments should, moreover,
consist of figures, that is, of images or symbols, that denote sacred use,
avoiding anything unbecoming to this.</p>

<p class="girm">345. Diversity of colour in the sacred vestments has as its
purpose to give more effective expression even outwardly whether to the
specific character of the mysteries of faith to be celebrated or to a sense of
Christian life’s passage through the course of the liturgical year.</p>

<p class="girm">346. As regards the colour of sacred vestments, traditional usage
should be observed, namely:</p>

<p class="girm">a) The colour white is used in the Offices and Masses during
Easter Time and Christmas Time; on the Solemnity of the Most Holy Trinity; and
furthermore on celebrations of the Lord other than of his Passion, celebrations
of the Blessed Virgin Mary, of the Holy Angels, and of Saints who were not
Martyrs; on the Solemnities of All Saints (November 1) and of the Nativity of
St John the Baptist (June24 ); and on the Feasts of St John the Evangelist
(December 27), of the Chair of St Peter (February 22), and of the Conversion of
St Paul (January 25).</p>

<p class="girm">b) The colour red is used on Palm Sunday of the Lord’s Passion
and on Friday of Holy Week (Good Friday), on Pentecost Sunday, on celebrations
of the Lord’s Passion, on the “birthday” feast days of Apostles and
Evangelists, and on celebrations of Martyr Saints.</p>

<p class="girm">c) The colour green is used in the Offices and Masses of Ordinary
Time.</p>

<p class="girm">d) The colour violet or purple is used in Advent and Lent. It may
also be worn in Offices and Masses for the Dead.</p>

<p class="girm">e) Besides the colour violet, the colours white or black may be
used at funeral services and at other Offices and Masses for the Dead in the
Dioceses of the United States of America.</p>

<p class="girm">f) The colour rose may be used, where it is the practice, on Gaudete
Sunday (Third Sunday of Advent) and on Laetare Sunday (Fourth Sunday of Lent).</p>

<p class="girm">g) On more solemn days, festive, that is, more precious, sacred
vestments may be used even if not of the colour of the day.</p>

<p class="girm">h) The colours gold or silver may be worn on more solemn
occasions in the Dioceses of the United States of America.</p>

<p class="girm">347. Ritual Masses are celebrated in their proper colour, in
white, or in a festive colour; Masses for Various Needs, on the other hand, are
celebrated in the colour proper to the day or the time of year or in violet if
they have a penitential character, for example, nos. 31, 33, or 38; Votive
Masses are celebrated in the colour suited to the Mass itself or even in the
colour proper to the day or the time of the year.</p>

<h5 class="calibre31">V. Other Things Intended for Church Use</h5>

<p class="girm">348. Besides the sacred vessels and the sacred vestments, for
which some particular material is prescribed, other furnishings that either are
intended for direct liturgical use<a href="iPriest%20Roman%20Missal%20SE%20USA%20-%20Roman%20Missal%20ICEL_split_884.htm#fn-139"> [139]</a><a id="fn-139-bl"></a> or are in any other way admitted into a church should be
worthy and in keeping with their particular intended purpose.</p>

<p class="girm">349. Special care must be taken to ensure that the liturgical
books, particularly the Book of the Gospels and the Lectionary, which are
intended for the proclamation of the Word of God and hence receive special
veneration, are to be in a liturgical action truly signs and symbols of higher
realities and hence should be truly worthy, dignified, and beautiful.</p>

<p class="girm">350. Furthermore, every care is to be taken with respect to those
things directly associated with the altar and the celebration of the Eucharist,
for example, the altar cross and the cross carried in procession.</p>

<p class="girm">351. Every effort should be made, even in minor matters, to
observe appropriately the requirements of art and to ensure that a noble
simplicity is combined with elegance.</p>
