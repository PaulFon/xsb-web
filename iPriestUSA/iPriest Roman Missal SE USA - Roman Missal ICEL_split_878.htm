<h2 id="calibre_toc_877" class="calibre10">Chapter IV: The Different Forms of Celebrating Mass</h2>

<p class="girm">112. In the local Church, first place should certainly be given,
because of its significance, to the Mass at which the Bishop presides,
surrounded by his Presbyterate, Deacons, and lay ministers,<a href="iPriest%20Roman%20Missal%20SE%20USA%20-%20Roman%20Missal%20ICEL_split_884.htm#fn-90">
[90]</a><a id="fn-90-bl"></a> and in which the holy People of God participate
fully and actively, for it is there that the principal manifestation of the
Church is found.</p>

<p class="girm">At a Mass celebrated by the Bishop or at which he presides
without celebrating the Eucharist, the norms found in the Caeremoniale
Episcoporum (Ceremonial of Bishops) should be observed.<a href="iPriest%20Roman%20Missal%20SE%20USA%20-%20Roman%20Missal%20ICEL_split_884.htm#fn-91"> [91]</a><a id="fn-91-bl"></a></p>

<p class="girm">113. Great importance should also be given to a Mass celebrated
with any community, but especially with the parish community, inasmuch as it
represents the universal Church at a given time and place, and chiefly in the
common Sunday celebration.<a href="iPriest%20Roman%20Missal%20SE%20USA%20-%20Roman%20Missal%20ICEL_split_884.htm#fn-92"> [92]</a><a id="fn-92-bl"></a></p>

<p class="girm">114. Moreover, among those Masses celebrated by some communities,
a particular place belongs to the Conventual Mass, which is a part of the daily
Office, or the “community” Mass. Although such Masses do not involve any
special form of celebration, it is nevertheless most fitting that they be<br class="wordsection"/>
celebrated with singing, especially with the full participation of all members
of the community, whether of religious or of canons. Therefore, in these Masses
all should exercise their function according to the Order or ministry they have
received. Hence, it is desirable that all the Priests who are not obliged to
celebrate individually for the pastoral benefit of the faithful concelebrate in
so far as possible at the conventual or community Mass. In addition, all
Priests belonging to the community who are obliged, as a matter of duty, to
celebrate individually for the pastoral benefit of the faithful may also on the
same day concelebrate at the conventual or community Mass.<a href="iPriest%20Roman%20Missal%20SE%20USA%20-%20Roman%20Missal%20ICEL_split_884.htm#fn-93">
[93]</a><a id="fn-93-bl"></a> For it is preferable that Priests who are present
at a celebration of the Eucharist, unless excused for a just reason, should
usually exercise the function proper to their Order and hence take part as
concelebrants, wearing sacred vestments. Otherwise, they wear their proper
choir dress or a surplice over a cassock.</p>

<h5 class="calibre31">I. Mass with the People</h5>

<p class="girm">115. By Mass with the people is meant a Mass celebrated with the
participation of the faithful. Moreover, it is appropriate, in so far as
possible, and especially on Sundays and Holydays of Obligation, that the
celebration take place with singing and with a suitable number of ministers.<a href="iPriest%20Roman%20Missal%20SE%20USA%20-%20Roman%20Missal%20ICEL_split_884.htm#fn-94"> [94]</a><a id="fn-94-bl"></a> It may, however, take place even
without singing and with only one minister.</p>

<p class="girm">116. If at any celebration of Mass a Deacon is present, he should
exercise his function. Furthermore, it is desirable that an acolyte, a reader,
and a cantor should usually be there to assist the Priest Celebrant. Indeed,
the rite described below foresees an even greater number of ministers.</p>

<h4 class="calibre5">Things to Be Prepared</h4>

<p class="girm">117. The altar is to be covered with at least one white cloth. In
addition, on or next to the altar are to be placed candlesticks with lighted
candles: at least two in any celebration, or even four or six, especially for a
Sunday Mass or a Holyday of Obligation, or if the Diocesan Bishop celebrates,
then seven candlesticks with lighted candles. Likewise, on the altar or close
to it, there is to be a cross adorned with a figure of Christ crucified. The
candles and the cross with the figure of Christ crucified may also be carried
in the procession at the Entrance. On the altar itself may be placed a Book of
the Gospels distinct from the book of other readings, unless it is carried in
the Entrance Procession.</p>

<p class="girm">118. Likewise these should be prepared:</p>

<p class="girm">a) next to the Priest’s chair: the Missal and, if appropriate, a
hymnal;</p>

<p class="girm">b) at the ambo: the Lectionary;</p>

<p class="girm">c) on the credence table: the chalice, corporal, purificator,
and, if appropriate, the pall; the paten and, if needed, ciboria; bread for the
Communion of the Priest who presides, the Deacon, the ministers, and the
people; cruets containing the wine and the water, unless all of these are
presented by the faithful in the procession at the Offertory; the vessel of
water to be blessed, if the sprinkling of holy water takes place; the
Communion-plate for the Communion of the faithful; and whatever is needed for
the washing of hands.</p>

<p class="girm">It is a praiseworthy practice for the chalice to be covered with
a veil, which may be either of the colour of the day or white.</p>

<p class="girm">119. In the sacristy, according to the various forms of
celebration, there should be prepared the sacred vestments (cf. nos. 337-341)
for the Priest, the Deacon, and other ministers:</p>

<p class="girm">a) for the Priest: the alb, the stole, and the chasuble;</p>

<p class="girm">b) for the Deacon: the alb, the stole, and the dalmatic; the
latter may be omitted, however, either out of necessity or on account of a
lesser degree of solemnity;</p>

<p class="girm">c) for the other ministers: albs or other lawfully approved
attire.<a href="iPriest%20Roman%20Missal%20SE%20USA%20-%20Roman%20Missal%20ICEL_split_884.htm#fn-95"> [95]</a><a id="fn-95-bl"></a></p>

<p class="girm">All who wear an alb should use a cincture and an amice unless,
due to the form of the alb, they are not needed.</p>

<p class="girm">When the Entrance takes place with a procession, the following
are also to be prepared: a Book of the Gospels; on Sundays and festive days, a
thurible and incense boat, if incense is being used; the cross to be carried in
procession; and candlesticks with lighted candles.</p>

<h3 class="calibre2">A) Mass without a Deacon</h3>

<h4 class="calibre5">The Introductory Rites</h4>

<p class="girm">120. When the people are gathered, the Priest and ministers,
wearing the sacred vestments, go in procession to the altar in this order:</p>

<p class="girm">a) the thurifer carrying a smoking thurible, if incense is being
used;</p>

<p class="girm">b) ministers who carry lighted candles, and between them an
acolyte or other minister with the cross;</p>

<p class="girm">c) the acolytes and the other ministers;</p>

<p class="girm">d) a reader, who may carry a Book of the Gospels (though not a
Lectionary), slightly elevated;</p>

<p class="girm">e) the Priest who is to celebrate the Mass.</p>

<p class="girm">If incense is being used, before the procession begins, the
Priest puts some into the thurible and blesses it with the Sign of the Cross
without saying anything.</p>

<p class="girm">121. During the procession to the altar, the Entrance Chant takes
place (cf. nos. 47-48).</p>

<p class="girm">122. When they reach the altar, the Priest and ministers make a
profound bow.</p>

<p class="girm">The cross adorned with a figure of Christ crucified, and carried
in procession, may be placed next to the altar to serve as the altar cross, in
which case it must be the only cross used; otherwise it is put away in a
dignified place. As for the candlesticks, these are placed on the altar or near
it. It is a praiseworthy practice for the Book of the Gospels to be placed on
the altar.</p>

<p class="girm">123. The Priest goes up to the altar and venerates it with a
kiss. Then, if appropriate, he incenses the cross and the altar, walking around
the latter.</p>

<p class="girm">124. Once all this has been done, the Priest goes to the chair.
When the Entrance Chant is concluded, with everybody standing, the Priest and
faithful sign themselves with the Sign of the Cross. The Priest says: In the
name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit. The people reply,
Amen.</p>

<p class="girm">Then, facing the people and extending his hands, the Priest
greets the people, using one of the formulas indicated. The Priest himself or
some other minister may also very briefly introduce the faithful to the Mass of
the day.</p>

<p class="girm">125. The Penitential Act follows. After this, the Kyrie is sung
or said, in accordance with the rubrics (cf. no. 52).</p>

<p class="calibre6">126. For celebrations where it is prescribed, the Gloria in
excelsis (Glory to God in the highest) is either sung or said (cf. no. 53).</p>

<p class="girm">127. The Priest then calls upon the people to pray, saying, with
hands joined, Let us pray. All pray silently with the Priest for a brief time.
Then the Priest, with hands extended, says the Collect, at the end of which the
people acclaim, Amen.</p>

<h4 class="calibre5">The Liturgy of the Word</h4>

<p class="girm">128. After the Collect, all sit. The Priest may, very briefly,
introduce the faithful to the Liturgy of the Word. Then the reader goes to the
ambo and, from the Lectionary already placed there before Mass, proclaims the
First Reading, to which all listen. At the end, the reader pronounces the
acclamation The word of the Lord, and all reply, Thanks be to God.</p>

<p class="girm">Then a few moments of silence may be observed, if appropriate, so
that all may meditate on what they have heard.</p>

<p class="girm">129. Then the psalmist or the reader proclaims the verses of the
Psalm and the people make the response as usual.</p>

<p class="girm">130. If there is to be a Second Reading before the Gospel, the
reader proclaims it from the ambo. All listen and at the end reply to the
acclamation, as noted above (no. 128). Then, if appropriate, a few moments of
silence may be observed.</p>

<p class="girm">131. After this, all rise, and the Alleluia or other chant is
sung as the liturgical time requires (cf. nos. 62-64).</p>

<p class="girm">132. During the singing of the Alleluia or other chant, if
incense is being used, the Priest puts some into the thurible and blesses it.
Then, with hands joined, he bows profoundly before the altar and quietly says
the prayer Munda cor meum (Cleanse my heart).</p>

<p class="girm">133. If the Book of the Gospels is on the altar, the Priest then
takes it and approaches the ambo, carrying the Book of the Gospels slightly
elevated. He is preceded by the lay ministers, who may carry the thurible and
the candles. Those present turn towards the ambo as a sign of special reverence
for the Gospel of Christ.</p>

<p class="girm">134. At the ambo, the Priest opens the book and, with hands
joined, says, The Lord be with you, to which the people reply, And with your
spirit. Then he says, A reading from the holy Gospel, making the Sign of the
Cross with his thumb on the book and on his forehead, mouth, and breast, which
everyone else does as well. The people acclaim, Glory to you, O Lord. The
Priest incenses the book, if incense is being used (cf. nos. 276-277). Then he
proclaims the Gospel and at the end pronounces the acclamation The Gospel of
the Lord, to which all reply, Praise to you, Lord Jesus Christ. The Priest
kisses the book, saying quietly the formula Per evangelica dicta (Through the
words of the Gospel).</p>

<p class="girm">135. If no reader is present, the Priest himself proclaims all
the readings and the Psalm, standing at the ambo. If incense is being used, he
puts some incense into the thurible at the ambo, blesses it, and, bowing
profoundly, says the prayer Munda cor meum (Cleanse my heart).</p>

<p class="girm">136. The Priest, standing at the chair or at the ambo itself or,
if appropriate, in another worthy place, gives the Homily. When the Homily is
over, a period of silence may be observed.</p>

<p class="girm">137. The Symbol or Creed is sung or recited by the Priest
together with the people (cf. no. 68) with everyone standing. At the words et
incarnatus est, etc. (and by the Holy Spirit... and became man) all make a
profound bow; but on the Solemnities of the Annunciation and of the Nativity of
the Lord, all genuflect.</p>

<p class="girm">138. After the recitation of the Symbol or Creed, the Priest,
standing at the chair with his hands joined, by means of a brief address calls
upon the faithful to participate in the Universal Prayer. Then the cantor, the
reader, or another person announces the intentions from the ambo or from some
other suitable place while facing the people. The latter take their part by
replying in supplication. At the very end, the Priest, with hands extended,
concludes the petitions with a prayer.</p>

<h4 class="calibre5">The Liturgy of the Eucharist</h4>

<p class="girm">139. When the Universal Prayer is over, all sit, and the
Offertory Chant begins (cf. no. 74).</p>

<p class="girm">An acolyte or other lay minister places the corporal, the
purificator, the chalice, the pall, and the Missal on the altar.</p>

<p class="girm">140. It is desirable that the participation of the faithful be
expressed by an offering, whether of bread and wine for the celebration of the
Eucharist or of other gifts to relieve the needs of the Church and of the poor.</p>

<p class="girm">The offerings of the faithful are received by the Priest,
assisted by the acolyte or other minister. The bread and wine for the Eucharist
are carried to the Celebrant, who places them on the altar, while other gifts
are put in another suitable place (cf. no. 73).</p>

<p class="girm">141. The Priest accepts the paten with the bread at the altar,
holds it slightly raised above the altar with both hands and says quietly,
Benedictus es, Domine (Blessed are you, Lord God). Then he places the paten
with the bread on the corporal.</p>

<p class="girm">142. After this, as the minister presents the cruets, the Priest
stands at the side of the altar and pours wine and a little water into the
chalice, saying quietly, Per huius aquae (By the mystery of this water). He
returns to the middle of the altar and with both hands raises the chalice a
little, and says quietly, Benedictus es, Domine (Blessed are you, Lord God).
Then he places the chalice on the corporal and, if appropriate, covers it with
a pall.</p>

<p class="girm">If, however, there is no Offertory Chant and the organ is not
played, in the presentation of the bread and wine the Priest may say the
formulas of blessing aloud and the people acclaim, Blessed be God for ever.</p>

<p class="girm">143. After placing the chalice on the altar, the Priest bows
profoundly and says quietly, In spiritu humilitatis (With humble spirit).</p>

<p class="girm">144. If incense is being used, the Priest then puts some in the
thurible, blesses it without saying anything, and incenses the offerings, the
cross, and the altar. While standing at the side of the altar, a minister
incenses the Priest and then the people.</p>

<p class="girm">145. After the prayer In spiritu humilitatis (With humble spirit)
or after the incensation, the Priest washes his hands standing at the side of
the altar and, as the minister pours the water, says quietly, Lava me, Domine
(Wash me, O Lord).</p>

<p class="girm">146. Returning to the middle of the altar, and standing facing
the people, the Priest extends and then joins his hands, and calls upon the
people to pray, saying, Orate, fratres (Pray, brethren). The people rise and
make the response May the Lord accept the sacrifice, etc. Then the Priest, with
hands extended, says the Prayer over the Offerings. At the end the people
acclaim, Amen.</p>

<p class="girm">147. Then the Priest begins the Eucharistic Prayer. In accordance
with the rubrics (cf. no. 365), he selects a Eucharistic Prayer from those
found in the Roman Missal or approved by the Apostolic See. By its very nature,
the Eucharistic Prayer requires that only the Priest say it, in virtue of his
Ordination. The people, for their part, should associate themselves with the
Priest in faith and in silence, as well as by means of their interventions as
prescribed in the course of the Eucharistic Prayer: namely, the responses in
the Preface dialogue, the Sanctus (Holy, Holy, Holy), the acclamation after the
Consecration, the acclamation Amen after the concluding doxology, as well as
other acclamations approved by the Conference of Bishops with the recognitio of
the Holy See.</p>

<p class="girm">It is most appropriate that the Priest sing those parts of the
Eucharistic Prayer for which musical notation is provided.</p>

<p class="girm">148. As he begins the Eucharistic Prayer, the Priest extends his
hands and sings or says, The Lord be with you. The people reply, And with your
spirit. As he continues, saying, Lift up your hearts, he raises his hands. The
people reply, We lift them up to the Lord. Then the Priest, with hands
extended, adds, Let us give thanks to the Lord our God, and the people reply,
It is right and just. After this, the Priest, with hands extended, continues
the Preface. At its conclusion, he joins his hands and, together with all those
present, sings or says aloud the Sanctus (Holy, Holy, Holy) (cf. no. 79 b).</p>

<p class="girm">149. The Priest continues the Eucharistic Prayer in accordance
with the rubrics that are set out in each of the Prayers.</p>

<p class="girm">If the celebrant is a Bishop, in the Prayers, after the words <span class="red1">N.</span>, our Pope, he adds, and me, your unworthy servant. If,
however, the Bishop is celebrating outside his own diocese, after the words
with... <span class="red1">N.</span>, our Pope, he adds, my brother <span class="red1">N.</span>, the Bishop of this Church, and me, your unworthy servant;
or after the words especially... <span class="red1">N.</span>, our Pope, he adds,
my brother <span class="red1">N.</span>, the Bishop of this Church, and me, your
unworthy servant.</p>

<p class="girm">The Diocesan Bishop, or one who is equivalent to the Diocesan
Bishop in law, must be mentioned by means of this formula: together with your
servant <span class="red1">N.</span>, our Pope, and <span class="red1">N.</span>,
our Bishop (or Vicar, Prelate, Prefect, Abbot).</p>

<p class="girm">It is permitted to mention Coadjutor Bishop and Auxiliary Bishops
in the Eucharistic Prayer, but not other Bishops who happen to be present. When
several are to be mentioned, this is done with the collective formula: <span class="red1">N.</span>, our Bishop and his assistant Bishops.</p>

<p class="girm">In each of the Eucharistic Prayers, these formulas are to be
adapted according to the requirements of grammar.</p>

<p class="girm">150. A little before the Consecration, if appropriate, a minister
rings a small bell as a signal to the faithful. The minister also rings the small
bell at each elevation by the Priest, according to local custom.</p>

<p class="girm">If incense is being used, when the host and the chalice are shown
to the people after the Consecration, a minister incenses them.</p>

<p class="girm">151. After the Consecration when the Priest has said, The mystery
of faith, the people pronounce the acclamation, using one of the prescribed
formulas.</p>

<p class="girm">At the end of the Eucharistic Prayer, the Priest takes the paten
with the host and the chalice and elevates them both while pronouncing alone
the doxology Through him. At the end the people acclaim, Amen. After this, the
Priest places the paten and the chalice on the corporal.</p>

<p class="girm">152. After the Eucharistic Prayer is concluded, the Priest, with
hands joined, says alone the introduction to the Lord’s Prayer, and then with
hands extended, he pronounces the prayer together with the people.</p>

<p class="girm">153. After the Lord’s Prayer is concluded, the Priest, with hands
extended, says alone the embolism Libera nos (Deliver us, Lord). At the end,
the people acclaim, For the kingdom.</p>

<p class="girm">154. Then the Priest, with hands extended, says aloud the prayer
Domine Iesu Christe, qui dixisti (Lord Jesus Christ, who said to your Apostles)
and when it is concluded, extending and then joining his hands, he announces
the greeting of peace, facing the people and saying, The peace of the Lord be
with you always. The people reply, And with your spirit. After this, if
appropriate, the Priest adds, Let us offer each other the sign of peace.</p>

<p class="girm">The Priest may give the Sign of Peace to the ministers but always
remains within the sanctuary, so that the celebration is not disrupted. In the
Dioceses of the United States of America, for a good reason, on special
occasions (for example, in the case of a funeral, a wedding, or when civic
leaders are present), the Priest may offer the Sign of Peace to a small number
of the faithful near the sanctuary. According to what is decided by the
Conference of Bishops, all express to one another peace, communion, and
charity. While the Sign of Peace is being given, it is permissible to say, The
peace of the Lord be with you always, to which the reply is Amen.</p>

<p class="girm">155. After this, the Priest takes the host, breaks it over the
paten, and places a small piece in the chalice, saying quietly, Haec commixtio
(May this mingling). Meanwhile the Agnus Dei (Lamb of God) is sung or said by
the choir and by the people (cf. no. 83).</p>

<p class="girm">156. Then the Priest, with hands joined, says quietly the prayer
for Communion, either Domine Iesu Christe, Fili Dei vivi (Lord Jesus Christ,
Son of the living God) or Perceptio Corporis et Sanguinis tui (May the
receiving of your Body and Blood).</p>

<p class="girm">157. When the prayer is concluded, the Priest genuflects, takes a
host consecrated at the same Mass, and, holding it slightly raised above the
paten or above the chalice, facing the people, says, Ecce Agnus Dei (Behold the
Lamb of God) and together with the people he adds, Lord, I am not worthy.</p>

<p class="girm">158. After this, standing facing the altar, the Priest says
quietly, Corpus Christi custodiat me in vitam aeternam (May the Body of Christ
keep me safe for eternal life), and reverently consumes the Body of Christ.
Then he takes the chalice, saying quietly, Sanguis Christi custodiat me in
vitam aeternam (May the Blood of Christ keep me safe for eternal life), and
reverently partakes of the Blood of Christ.</p>

<p class="girm">159. While the Priest is receiving the Sacrament, the Communion
Chant begins (cf. no. 86).</p>

<p class="girm">160. The Priest then takes the paten or ciborium and approaches
the communicants, who usually come up in procession.</p>

<p class="girm">It is not permitted for the faithful to take the consecrated
Bread or the sacred chalice by themselves and, still less, to hand them on from
one to another among themselves. The norm established for the Dioceses of the
United States of America is that Holy Communion is to be received standing,
unless an individual member of the faithful wishes to receive Communion while
kneeling (Congregation for Divine Worship and the Discipline of the Sacraments,
Instruction, Redemptionis Sacramentum, March 25, 2004, no. 91).</p>

<p class="girm">When receiving Holy Communion, the communicant bows his or her
head before the Sacrament as a gesture of reverence and receives the Body of
the Lord from the minister. The consecrated host may be received either on the
tongue or in the hand, at the discretion of each communicant. When Holy
Communion is received under both kinds, the sign of reverence is also made
before receiving the Precious Blood.</p>

<p class="girm">161. If Communion is given only under the species of bread, the
Priest raises the host slightly and shows it to each, saying, The Body of Christ.
The communicant replies, Amen, and receives the Sacrament either on the tongue
or, where this is allowed, in the hand, the choice lying with the communicant.
As soon as the communicant receives the host, he or she consumes the whole of
it.</p>

<p class="girm">If, however, Communion is given under both kinds, the rite
prescribed in nos. 284-287 is to be followed.</p>

<p class="girm">162. In the distribution of Communion the Priest may be assisted
by other Priests who happen to be present. If such Priests are not present and
there is a truly large number of communicants, the Priest may call upon
extraordinary ministers to assist him, that is, duly instituted acolytes or
even other faithful who have been duly deputed for this purpose.<a href="iPriest%20Roman%20Missal%20SE%20USA%20-%20Roman%20Missal%20ICEL_split_884.htm#fn-96">
[96]</a><a id="fn-96-bl"></a> In case of necessity, the Priest may depute
suitable faithful for this single occasion.<a href="iPriest%20Roman%20Missal%20SE%20USA%20-%20Roman%20Missal%20ICEL_split_884.htm#fn-97"> [97]</a><a id="fn-97-bl"></a></p>

<p class="girm">These ministers should not approach the altar before the Priest
has received Communion, and they are always to receive from the hands of the
Priest Celebrant the vessel containing the species of the Most Holy Eucharist
for distribution to the faithful.</p>

<p class="girm">163. When the distribution of Communion is over, the Priest
himself immediately and completely consumes at the altar any consecrated wine
that happens to remain; as for any consecrated hosts that are left, he either
consumes them at the altar or carries them to the place designated for the
reservation of the Eucharist.</p>

<p class="girm">Upon returning to the altar, the Priest collects the fragments,
should any remain, and he stands at the altar or at the credence table and
purifies the paten or ciborium over the chalice, and after this purifies the
chalice, saying quietly the formula Quod ore sumpsimus, Domine (What has passed
our lips), and dries the chalice with a purificator. If the vessels are
purified at the altar, they are carried to the credence table by a minister.
Nevertheless, it is also permitted to leave vessels needing to be purified,
especially if there are several, on a corporal, suitably covered, either on the
altar or on the credence table, and to purify them immediately after Mass,
after the Dismissal of the people.</p>

<p class="girm">164. After this, the Priest may return to the chair. A sacred
silence may now be observed for some time, or a Psalm or other canticle of
praise or a hymn may be sung (cf. no. 88).</p>

<p class="girm">165. Then, standing at the chair or at the altar, and facing the
people with hands joined, the Priest says, Let us pray; then, with hands
extended, he recites the Prayer after Communion. A brief period of silence may
precede the prayer, unless this has been already observed immediately after
Communion. At the end of the prayer the people acclaim, Amen.</p>

<h4 class="calibre5">The Concluding Rites</h4>

<p class="girm">166. When the Prayer after Communion is concluded, brief
announcements should be made to the people, if there are any.</p>

<p class="girm">167. Then the Priest, extending his hands, greets the people,
saying, The Lord be with you. They reply, And with your spirit. The Priest,
joining his hands again and then immediately placing his left hand on his
breast, raises his right hand and adds, May almighty God bless you and, as he
makes the Sign of the Cross over the people, he continues, the Father, and the
Son, and the Holy Spirit. All reply, Amen.</p>

<p class="girm">On certain days and occasions this blessing, in accordance with
the rubrics, is expanded and expressed by a Prayer over the People or another
more solemn formula.</p>

<p class="girm">A Bishop blesses the people with the appropriate formula, making
the Sign of the Cross three times over the people.<a href="iPriest%20Roman%20Missal%20SE%20USA%20-%20Roman%20Missal%20ICEL_split_884.htm#fn-98"> [98]</a><a id="fn-98-bl"></a></p>

<p class="girm">168. Immediately after the Blessing, with hands joined, the
Priest adds, Ite, missa est (Go forth, the Mass is ended) and all reply, Thanks
be to God.</p>

<p class="girm">169. Then the Priest venerates the altar as usual with a kiss
and, after making a profound bow with the lay ministers, he withdraws with
them.</p>

<p class="girm">170. If, however, another liturgical action follows the Mass, the
Concluding Rites, that is, the Greeting, the Blessing, and the Dismissal, are
omitted.</p>

<h3 class="calibre2">B) Mass with a Deacon</h3>

<p class="girm">171. When he is present at the celebration of the Eucharist, a
Deacon should exercise his ministry, wearing sacred vestments. In fact, the
Deacon:</p>

<p class="girm">a) assists the Priest and walks at his side;</p>

<p class="girm">b) ministers at the altar, both as regards the chalice and the
book;</p>

<p class="girm">c) proclaims the Gospel and may, at the direction of the Priest
Celebrant, give the Homily (cf. no. 66);</p>

<p class="girm">d) guides the faithful people by giving appropriate instructions,
and announces the intentions of the Universal Prayer;</p>

<p class="girm">e) assists the Priest Celebrant in distributing Communion, and
purifies and arranges the sacred vessels;</p>

<p class="girm">f) carries out the duties of other ministers himself, if
necessary, when none of them is present.</p>

<h4 class="calibre5">The Introductory Rites</h4>

<p class="girm">172. Carrying the Book of the Gospels slightly elevated, the
Deacon precedes the Priest as he approaches the altar or else walks at the
Priest’s side.</p>

<p class="girm">173. When he reaches the altar, if he is carrying the Book of the
Gospels, he omits the sign of reverence and goes up to the altar. It is a
praiseworthy practice for him to place the Book of the Gospels on the altar,
after which, together with the Priest, he venerates the altar with a kiss.</p>

<p class="girm">If, however, he is not carrying the Book of the Gospels, he makes
a profound bow to the altar with the Priest in the customary way and with him
venerates the altar with a kiss.</p>

<p class="girm">Lastly, if incense is being used, he assists the Priest in
putting some into the thurible and in incensing the cross and the altar.</p>

<p class="girm">174. Once the altar has been incensed, the Deacon goes to the
chair together with the Priest and there stands at the Priest’s side and
assists him as necessary.</p>

<h4 class="calibre5">The Liturgy of the Word</h4>

<p class="girm">175. During the singing of the Alleluia or other chant, if
incense is being used, the Deacon ministers to the Priest as he puts incense
into the thurible. Then, bowing profoundly before the Priest, he asks for the
blessing, saying in a low voice, Your blessing, Father. The Priest blesses him,
saying, May the Lord be in your heart. The Deacon signs himself with the Sign
of the Cross and replies, Amen. Having bowed to the altar, he then takes up the
Book of the Gospels which was placed on it and proceeds to the ambo, carrying
the book slightly elevated. He is preceded by a thurifer carrying a smoking
thurible and by ministers with lighted candles. At the ambo the Deacon greets
the people, with hands joined, saying, The Lord be with you. After this, at the
words A reading from the holy Gospel, he signs with his thumb the book and then
himself on his forehead, mouth, and breast. He incenses the book and proclaims
the Gospel reading. When this is done, he acclaims, The Gospel of the Lord, and
all reply, Praise to you, Lord Jesus Christ. He then venerates the book with a
kiss, saying quietly the formula Per evangelica dicta (Through the words of the
Gospel), and returns to the Priest’s side.</p>

<p class="girm">When the Deacon is assisting the Bishop, he carries the book to
him to be kissed, or else kisses it himself, saying quietly the formula Per
evangelica dicta (Through the words of the Gospel). In more solemn
celebrations, if appropriate, the Bishop may impart a blessing to the people
with the Book of the Gospels.</p>

<p class="girm">Lastly, the Deacon may carry the Book of the Gospels to the
credence table or to another suitable and dignified place.</p>

<p class="girm">176. Moreover, if there is no other suitable reader present, the
Deacon should proclaim the other readings as well.</p>

<p class="girm">177. After the introduction by the Priest, it is the Deacon
himself who announces the intentions of the Universal Prayer, usually from the
ambo.</p>

<h4 class="calibre5">The Liturgy of the Eucharist</h4>

<p class="girm">178. After the Universal Prayer, while the Priest remains at the
chair, the Deacon prepares the altar, assisted by the acolyte, but it is the
Deacon’s place to take care of the sacred vessels himself. He also assists the
Priest in receiving the people’s gifts. After this, he hands the Priest the
paten with the bread to be consecrated, pours wine and a little water into the
chalice, saying quietly, By the mystery of this water, etc., and after this
presents the chalice to the Priest. He may also carry out the preparation of
the chalice at the credence table. If incense is being used, the Deacon assists
the Priest during the incensation of the offerings, the cross, and the altar;
and after this the Deacon himself or the acolyte incenses the Priest and the
people.</p>

<p class="girm">179. During the Eucharistic Prayer, the Deacon stands near the
Priest, but slightly behind him, so that when necessary he may assist the
Priest with the chalice or the Missal.</p>

<p class="girm">From the epiclesis until the Priest shows the chalice, the Deacon
usually remains kneeling. If several Deacons are present, one of them may place
incense in the thurible for the Consecration and incense the host and the
chalice at the elevation.</p>

<p class="girm">180. At the concluding doxology of the Eucharistic Prayer, the
Deacon stands next to the Priest, and holds the chalice elevated while the
Priest elevates the paten with the host, until the people have acclaimed, Amen.</p>

<p class="girm">181. After the Priest has said the prayer for the Rite of Peace
and the greeting The peace of the Lord be with you always and the people have
replied, And with your spirit, the Deacon, if appropriate, says the invitation
to the Sign of Peace. With hands joined, he faces the people and says, Let us
offer each other the sign of peace. Then he himself receives the Sign of Peace
from the Priest and may offer it to those other ministers who are nearest to
him.</p>

<p class="girm">182. After the Priest’s Communion, the Deacon receives Communion
under both kinds from the Priest himself and then assists the Priest in
distributing Communion to the people. If Communion is given under both kinds,
the Deacon himself administers the chalice to the communicants; and, when the
distribution is over, standing at the altar, he immediately and reverently
consumes all of the Blood of Christ that remains, assisted, if the case
requires, by other Deacons and Priests.</p>

<p class="girm">183. When the distribution of Communion is over, the Deacon
returns to the altar with the Priest, collects the fragments, should any
remain, and then carries the chalice and other sacred vessels to the credence
table, where he purifies them and arranges them as usual, while the Priest
returns to the chair. Nevertheless, it is also permitted to leave vessels
needing to be purified on a corporal, suitably covered, on the credence table,
and to purify them immediately after Mass, following the Dismissal of the
people.</p>

<h4 class="calibre5">The Concluding Rites</h4>

<p class="girm">184. Once the Prayer after Communion has been said, the Deacon
makes brief announcements to the people, if indeed any need to be made, unless
the Priest prefers to do this himself.</p>

<p class="girm">185. If a Prayer over the People or a formula of Solemn Blessing
is used, the Deacon says, Bow down for the blessing. After the Priest’s
blessing, the Deacon, with hands joined and facing the people, dismisses the
people, saying, Ite, missa est (Go forth, the Mass is ended).</p>

<p class="girm">186. Then, together with the Priest, the Deacon venerates the
altar with a kiss, makes a profound bow, and withdraws in a manner similar to
the Entrance Procession.</p>

<h3 class="calibre2">C) The Functions of the Acolyte</h3>

<p class="girm">187. The functions that the acolyte may carry out are of various
kinds and several may occur at the same moment. Hence, it is desirable that
these duties be suitably distributed among several acolytes. If, in fact, only
one acolyte is present, he should perform the more important duties while the
rest are to be distributed among several ministers.</p>

<h4 class="calibre5">The Introductory Rites</h4>

<p class="girm">188. In the procession to the altar, the acolyte may carry the
cross, walking between two ministers with lighted candles. Upon reaching the
altar, however, the acolyte places the cross upright near the altar so that it
may serve as the altar cross; otherwise, he puts it away in a dignified place.
Then he takes his place in the sanctuary.</p>

<p class="girm">189. Through the entire celebration, it is for the acolyte to
approach the Priest or the Deacon, whenever necessary, in order to present the
book to them and to assist them in any other way required. Thus it is
appropriate that, in so far as possible, the acolyte should occupy a place from
which he can easily carry out his ministry either at the chair or at the altar.</p>

<h4 class="calibre5">The Liturgy of the Eucharist</h4>

<p class="girm">190. In the absence of a Deacon, after the Universal Prayer and
while the Priest remains at the chair, the acolyte places the corporal, the
purificator, the chalice, the pall, and the Missal on the altar. Then, if
necessary, the acolyte assists the Priest in receiving the gifts of the people
and, if appropriate, brings the bread and wine to the altar and hands them to
the Priest. If incense is being used, the acolyte presents the thurible to the
Priest and assists him while he incenses the offerings, the cross, and the
altar. Then the acolyte incenses the Priest and the people.</p>

<p class="girm">191. A duly instituted acolyte, as an extraordinary minister,
may, if necessary, assist the Priest in distributing Communion to the people.<a href="iPriest%20Roman%20Missal%20SE%20USA%20-%20Roman%20Missal%20ICEL_split_884.htm#fn-99"> [99]</a><a id="fn-99-bl"></a> If Communion is given under both
kinds, in the absence of a Deacon, the acolyte administers the chalice to the
communicants or holds the chalice if Communion is given by intinction.</p>

<p class="girm">192. Likewise, after the distribution of Communion is complete, a
duly instituted acolyte helps the Priest or Deacon to purify and arrange the
sacred vessels. In the absence of a Deacon, a duly instituted acolyte carries
the sacred vessels to the credence table and there purifies them, wipes them,
and arranges them as usual.</p>

<p class="girm">193. After the celebration of Mass, the acolyte and other
ministers return together with the Deacon and the Priest in procession to the
sacristy, in the same manner and in the same order in which they entered.</p>

<h3 class="calibre2">D) The Functions of the Reader</h3>

<h4 class="calibre5">Introductory Rites</h4>

<p class="girm">194. In the procession to the altar, in the absence of a Deacon,
the reader, wearing approved attire, may carry the Book of the Gospels,
slightly elevated. In that case, the reader walks in front of the Priest but
otherwise walks along with the other ministers.</p>

<p class="girm">195. Upon reaching the altar, the reader makes a profound bow
with the others. If he is carrying the Book of the Gospels, he approaches the
altar and places the Book of the Gospels upon it. Then the reader takes his own
place in the sanctuary with the other ministers.</p>

<h4 class="calibre5">The Liturgy of the Word</h4>

<p class="girm">196. The reader reads from the ambo the readings that precede the
Gospel. In the absence of a psalmist, the reader may also proclaim the
Responsorial Psalm after the First Reading.</p>

<p class="girm">197. In the absence of a Deacon, the reader, after the
introduction by the Priest, may announce the intentions of the Universal Prayer
from the ambo.</p>

<p class="girm">198. If there is no singing at the Entrance or at Communion and
the antiphons given in the Missal are not recited by the faithful, the reader
may read them at an appropriate time (cf. nos. 48, 87).</p>

<h5 class="calibre31">II. Concelebrated Mass</h5>

<p class="girm">199. Concelebration, by which the unity of the Priesthood, of the
Sacrifice, and also of the whole People of God is appropriately expressed, is
prescribed by the rite itself for the Ordination of a Bishop and of Priests, at
the Blessing of an Abbot, and at the Chrism Mass.</p>

<p class="girm">It is recommended, moreover, unless the good of the Christian
faithful requires or suggests otherwise, at:</p>

<p class="girm">a) the Evening Mass of the Lord’s Supper;</p>

<p class="girm">b) the Mass during Councils, gatherings of Bishops, and Synods;</p>

<p class="girm">c) the Conventual Mass and the principal Mass in churches and
oratories;</p>

<p class="girm">d) Masses at any kind of gathering of Priests, either secular or
religious.<a href="iPriest%20Roman%20Missal%20SE%20USA%20-%20Roman%20Missal%20ICEL_split_884.htm#fn-100"> [100]</a><a id="fn-100-bl"></a></p>

<p class="girm">Every Priest, however, is allowed to celebrate the Eucharist
individually, though not at the same time as a concelebration is taking place
in the same church or oratory. However, on Holy Thursday, and for the Mass of
the Easter Vigil, it is not permitted to celebrate Mass individually.</p>

<p class="girm">200. Visiting Priests should be gladly admitted to concelebration
of the Eucharist, provided their Priestly standing has been ascertained.</p>

<p class="girm">201. When there is a large number of Priests, concelebration may
take place even several times on the same day, where necessity or pastoral
advantage commend it. However, this must be done at different times or in
distinct sacred places.<a href="iPriest%20Roman%20Missal%20SE%20USA%20-%20Roman%20Missal%20ICEL_split_884.htm#fn-101"> [101]</a><a id="fn-101-bl"></a></p>

<p class="girm">202. It is for the Bishop, in accordance with the norm of law, to
regulate the discipline for concelebration in all churches and oratories of his
diocese.</p>

<p class="girm">203. To be held in particularly high regard is that
concelebration in which the Priests of any given diocese concelebrate with
their own Bishop at a stational Mass, especially on the more solemn days of the
liturgical year, at the Ordination Mass of a new Bishop of the diocese or of
his Coadjutor or Auxiliary, at the Chrism Mass, at the Evening Mass of the
Lord’s Supper, at celebrations of the Founder Saint of a local Church or the
Patron of the diocese, on anniversaries of the Bishop, and, lastly, on the
occasion of a Synod or a pastoral visitation.</p>

<p class="girm">In the same way, concelebration is recommended whenever Priests
gather together with their own Bishop whether on the occasion of a retreat or
at any other gathering. In these cases the sign of the unity of the Priesthood
and also of the Church inherent in every concelebration is made more clearly
manifest.<a href="iPriest%20Roman%20Missal%20SE%20USA%20-%20Roman%20Missal%20ICEL_split_884.htm#fn-102"> [102]</a><a id="fn-102-bl"></a></p>

<p class="girm">204. For a particular reason, having to do either with the
significance of the rite or of the festivity, the faculty is given to celebrate
or concelebrate more than once on the same day in the following cases:</p>

<p class="girm">a) a Priest who has celebrated or concelebrated the Chrism Mass
on Thursday of Holy Week may also celebrate or concelebrate the Evening Mass of
the Lord’s Supper;</p>

<p class="girm">b) a Priest who has celebrated or concelebrated the Mass of the
Easter Vigil may celebrate or concelebrate Mass during the day on Easter Sunday;</p>

<p class="girm">c) on the Nativity of the Lord (Christmas Day), all Priests may
celebrate or concelebrate three Masses, provided the Masses are celebrated at
their proper times of day;</p>

<p class="girm">d) on the Commemoration of All the Faithful Departed (All Souls’
Day), all Priests may celebrate or concelebrate three Masses, provided that the
celebrations take place at different times, and with due regard for what has
been laid down regarding the application of second and third Masses;<a href="iPriest%20Roman%20Missal%20SE%20USA%20-%20Roman%20Missal%20ICEL_split_884.htm#fn-103"> [103]</a><a id="fn-103-bl"></a></p>

<p class="girm">e) a Priest who concelebrates with the Bishop or his delegate at
a Synod or pastoral visitation, or concelebrates on the occasion of a gathering
of Priests, may celebrate Mass again for the benefit of the faithful. This
holds also, with due regard for the prescriptions of law, for groups of
religious.</p>

<p class="girm">205. A concelebrated Mass, whatever its form, is arranged in
accordance with the norms commonly in force (cf. nos. 112-198), observing or
adapting however what is set out below.</p>

<p class="girm">206. No one is ever to join a concelebration or to be admitted as
a concelebrant once the Mass has already begun.</p>

<p class="girm">207. In the sanctuary there should be prepared:</p>

<p class="girm">a) seats and texts for the concelebrating Priests;</p>

<p class="girm">b) on the credence table: a chalice of sufficient size or else
several chalices.</p>

<p class="girm">208. If a Deacon is not present, the functions proper to him are
to be carried out by some of the concelebrants.</p>

<p class="girm">If other ministers are also absent, their proper parts may be
entrusted to other suitable faithful laypeople; otherwise, they are carried out
by some of the concelebrants.</p>

<p class="girm">209. The concelebrants put on in the vesting room, or other
suitable place, the sacred vestments they customarily wear when celebrating
Mass individually. However, should a just cause arise (e.g., a more
considerable number of concelebrants or a lack of vestments), concelebrants
other than the principal celebrant may omit the chasuble and simply wear the
stole over the alb.</p>

<h4 class="calibre5">The Introductory Rites</h4>

<p class="girm">210. When everything has been properly arranged, the procession
moves as usual through the church to the altar. The concelebrating Priests walk
ahead of the principal celebrant.</p>

<p class="girm">211. On arriving at the altar, the concelebrants and the
principal celebrant, after making a profound bow, venerate the altar with a
kiss, then go to their designated seats. As for the principal celebrant, if
appropriate, he incenses the cross and the altar and then goes to the chair.</p>

<h4 class="calibre5">The Liturgy of the Word</h4>

<p class="girm">212. During the Liturgy of the Word, the concelebrants remain at
their places, sitting or standing whenever the principal celebrant does.</p>

<p class="girm">When the Alleluia is begun, all rise, exept for a Bishop, who
puts incense into the thurible without saying anything and blesses the Deacon
or, in the absence of a Deacon, the concelebrant who is to proclaim the Gospel.
However, in a concelebration where a Priest presides, the concelebrant who in
the absence of a Deacon proclaims the Gospel neither requests nor receives the
blessing of the principal celebrant.</p>

<p class="girm">213. The Homily is usually given by the principal celebrant or by
one of the concelebrants.</p>

<h4 class="calibre5">The Liturgy of the Eucharist</h4>

<p class="girm">214. The Preparation of the Gifts (cf. nos. 139-146) is carried
out by the principal celebrant, while the other concelebrants remain at their
places.</p>

<p class="girm">215. After the Prayer over the Offerings has been said by the
principal celebrant, the concelebrants approach the altar and stand around it,
but in such a way that they do not obstruct the execution of the rites and that
the sacred action may be seen clearly by the faithful. Nor should they obstruct
the Deacon whenever he needs to approach the altar by reason of his ministry.</p>

<p class="girm">The Deacon exercises his ministry near the altar, assisting
whenever necessary with the chalice and the Missal. However, in so far as
possible, he stands back slightly, behind the concelebrating Priests standing
around the principal celebrant.</p>

<h4 class="calibre5">The Manner of Pronouncing the Eucharistic Prayer</h4>

<p class="girm">216. The Preface is sung or said by the principal Priest
Celebrant alone; but the Sanctus (Holy, Holy, Holy) is sung or recited by all
the concelebrants, together with the people and the choir.</p>

<p class="girm">217. After the Sanctus (Holy, Holy, Holy), the concelebrating
Priests continue the Eucharistic Prayer in the way described below. Only the
principal celebrant makes the gestures, unless other indications are given.</p>

<p class="girm">218. The parts pronounced by all the concelebrants together and
especially the words of Consecration, which all are obliged to say, are to be
recited in such a manner that the concelebrants speak them in a low voice and
that the principal celebrant’s voice is heard clearly. In this way the words
can be more easily understood by the people.</p>

<p class="girm">It is a praiseworthy practice for the parts that are to be said
by all the concelebrants together and for which musical notation is provided in
the Missal to be sung.</p>

<h4 class="calibre5">Eucharistic Prayer I, or the Roman Canon</h4>

<p class="girm">219. In Eucharistic Prayer I, or the Roman Canon, the Te igitur
(To you, therefore, most merciful Father) is said by the principal celebrant
alone, with hands extended.</p>

<p class="calibre6">220. It is appropriate that the commemoration (Memento) of the
living and the Communicantes (In communion with those) be assigned to one or
other of the concelebrating Priests, who then pronounces these prayers alone,
with hands extended, and in a loud voice.</p>

<p class="girm">221. The Hanc igitur (Therefore, Lord, we pray) is said once
again by the principal celebrant alone, with hands extended.</p>

<p class="girm">222. From the Quam oblationem (Be pleased, O God, we pray) up to
and including the Supplices (In humble prayer we ask you, almighty God), the<br class="wordsection"/>
principal celebrant alone makes the gestures, while all the concelebrants
pronounce everything together, in this manner:</p>

<p class="girm">a) the Quam oblationem (Be pleased, O God, we pray) with hands
extended toward the offerings;</p>

<p class="girm">b) the Qui pridie (On the day before he was to suffer) and the
Simili modo (In a similar way) with hands joined;</p>

<p class="girm">c) the words of the Lord, with each extending his right hand
toward the bread and toward the chalice, if this seems appropriate; and at the
elevation looking toward them and after this bowing profoundly;</p>

<p class="girm">d) the Unde et memores (Therefore, O Lord, as we celebrate the
memorial) and the Supra quae (Be pleased to look upon) with hands extended;</p>

<p class="girm">e) for the Supplices (In humble prayer we ask you, almighty God)
up to and including the words through this participation at the altar, bowing
with hands joined; then standing upright and crossing themselves at the words
may be filled with every grace and heavenly blessing.</p>

<p class="girm">223. It is appropriate that the commemoration (Memento) of the
dead and the Nobis quoque peccatoribus (To us, also, your servants) be assigned
to one or other of the concelebrants, who pronounces them alone, with hands
extended, and in a loud voice.</p>

<p class="girm">224. At the words To us, also, your servants, who though sinners,
of the Nobis quoque peccatoribus, all the concelebrants strike their breast.</p>

<p class="girm">225. The Per quem haec omnia (Through whom you continue) is said
by the principal celebrant alone.</p>

<h4 class="calibre5">Eucharistic Prayer II</h4>

<p class="girm">226. In Eucharistic Prayer II, the part You are indeed Holy, O
Lord is pronounced by the principal celebrant alone, with hands extended.</p>

<p class="girm">227. In the parts from Make holy, therefore, these gifts to the
end of Humbly we pray, all the concelebrants pronounce everything together as
follows:</p>

<p class="girm">a) the part Make holy, therefore, these gifts, with hands
extended toward the offerings;</p>

<p class="girm">b) the parts At the time he was betrayed and In a similar way
with hands joined;</p>

<p class="girm">c) the words of the Lord, with each extending his right hand

looking toward them and after this bowing profoundly;</p>

<p class="girm">d) the parts Therefore, as we celebrate and Humbly we pray with
hands extended.</p>

<p class="girm">228. It is appropriate that the intercessions for the living,
Remember, Lord, your Church, and for the dead, Remember also our brothers and
sisters, be assigned to one or other of the concelebrants, who pronounces them
alone, with hands extended, and in a loud voice.</p>

<h4 class="calibre5">Eucharistic Prayer III</h4>

<p class="girm">229. In Eucharistic Prayer III, the part You are indeed Holy, O

everything together as follows:</p>

<p class="girm">a) the part Therefore, O Lord, we humbly implore you with hands
extended toward the offerings;</p>

<p class="girm">b) the parts For on the night he was betrayed and In a similar
way with hands joined;</p>

<p class="girm">c) the words of the Lord, with each extending his right hand

elevation looking toward them and after this bowing profoundly;</p>

<p class="girm">d) the parts Therefore, O Lord, as we celebrate the memorial and
Look, we pray, upon the oblation with hands extended.</p>

<p class="girm">231. It is appropriate that the intercessions May he make of us
an eternal offering to you, and May this Sacrifice of our reconciliation, and
To our departed brothers and sisters be assigned to one or other of the
concelebrants, who pronounces them alone, with hands extended, and in a loud
voice.</p>

<h4 class="calibre5">Eucharistic Prayer IV</h4>

<p class="girm">232. In Eucharistic Prayer IV, the part We give you praise,
Father most holy up to and including the words he might sanctify creation to
the full is pronounced by the principal celebrant alone, with hands extended.</p>

<p class="girm">233. In the parts from Therefore, O Lord, we pray to the end of

concelebrants, who pronounces them alone, with hands extended, and in a loud
voice.</p>

<p class="girm">235. As for other Eucharistic Prayers approved by the Apostolic
See, the norms laid down for each one are to be observed.</p>

<p class="girm">236. The concluding doxology of the Eucharistic Prayer is
pronounced solely by the principal Priest Celebrant or together, if this is
desired, with the other concelebrants, but not by the faithful.</p>

<h4 class="calibre5">The Communion Rite</h4>

<p class="girm">237. Then the principal celebrant, with hands joined, says the
introduction to the Lord’s Prayer. Next, with hands extended, he says the
Lord’s Prayer itself together with the other concelebrants, who also pray with
hands extended, and together with the people.</p>

<p class="girm">238. The Libera nos (Deliver us) is said by the principal
celebrant alone, with hands extended. All the concelebrants, together with the
people, pronounce the concluding acclamation For the kingdom.</p>

<p class="girm">239. After the Deacon or, in the absence of a Deacon, one of the
concele-brants, has given the instruction Let us offer each other the sign of
peace, all give one another the Sign of Peace. Those concelebrants nearer the
principal celebrant receive the Sign of Peace from him before the Deacon does.</p>

<p class="girm">240. During the Agnus Dei (Lamb of God), the Deacons or some of
the concelebrants may help the principal celebrant to break the hosts for the
Communion of both the concelebrants and the people.</p>

<p class="girm">241. After the commingling, the principal celebrant alone, with
hands joined, quietly says either the prayer Domine Iesu Christe, Fili Dei vivi
(Lord Jesus Christ, Son of the living God) or the prayer Perceptio Corporis et
Sanguinis tui (May the receiving of your Body and Blood).</p>

<p class="girm">242. Once the prayer for Communion has been said, the principal
celebrant genuflects and steps back a little. Then one after another the
concelebrants come to the middle of the altar, genuflect, and reverently take
the Body of Christ from the altar. Then holding it in their right hand, with
the left hand placed underneath, they return to their places. However, the
concelebrants may remain in their places and take the Body of Christ from the
paten held for them by the principal celebrant or held by one or more of the
concele-brants passing in front of them, or they may do so by handing the paten
one to another, and so to the last of them.</p>

<p class="girm">243. Then the principal celebrant takes a host consecrated in the
same Mass, holds it slightly raised above the paten or the chalice, and, facing
the people, says the Ecce Agnus Dei (Behold the Lamb of God). With the
concelebrants and the people he continues, saying the Domine, non sum dignus
(Lord, I am not worthy).</p>

<p class="girm">244. Then the principal celebrant, facing the altar, says
quietly, Corpus Christi custodiat me in vitam aeternam (May the Body of Christ
keep me safe for eternal life), and reverently receives the Body of Christ. The
concelebrants do likewise, giving themselves Communion. After them the Deacon
receives the Body and Blood of the Lord from the principal celebrant.</p>

<p class="girm">245. The Blood of the Lord may be consumed either by drinking
from the chalice directly, or by intinction, or by means of a tube or a spoon.</p>

<p class="girm">246. If Communion is consumed by drinking directly from the
chalice, one of these procedures may be followed:</p>

<p class="girm">a) The principal celebrant, standing at the middle of the altar,
takes the chalice and says quietly, Sanguis Christi custodiat me in vitam
aeternam (May the Blood of Christ keep me safe for eternal life). He consumes a
little of the Blood of Christ and hands the chalice to the Deacon or a concelebrant.
He then distributes Communion to the faithful (cf. nos. 160-162). The
concelebrants approach the altar one after another or, if two chalices are
used, two by two. They genuflect, partake of the Blood of Christ, wipe the rim
of the chalice, and return to their seats.</p>

<p class="girm">b) The principal celebrant consumes the Blood of the Lord
standing as usual at the middle of the altar.</p>

<p class="girm">The concelebrants, however, may partake of the Blood of the Lord
while remaining in their places and drinking from the chalice presented to them
by the Deacon or by one of the concelebrants, or even passed from one to the
other. The chalice is always wiped either by the one who drinks from it or by
the one who presents it. After each has communicated, he returns to his seat.</p>

<p class="girm">247. The Deacon reverently drinks at the altar all of the Blood
of Christ that remains, assisted, if the case requires, by some of the
concelebrants. He then carries the chalice to the credence table and there he
or a duly instituted acolyte purifies it, wipes it, and arranges it as usual
(cf. no. 183).</p>

<p class="girm">248. The Communion of the concelebrants may also be arranged in
such a way that each communicates from the Body of the Lord at the altar and,
immediately afterwards, from the Blood of the Lord.</p>

<p class="girm">In this case the principal celebrant receives Communion under
both kinds in the usual way (cf. no. 158), observing, however, the rite chosen
in each particular instance for Communion from the chalice; and the other
concelebrants should do the same.</p>

<p class="girm">After the principal celebrant’s Communion, the chalice is placed
at the side of the altar on another corporal. The concelebrants approach the
middle of the altar one by one, genuflect, and communicate from the Body of the
Lord; then they move to the side of the altar and partake of the Blood of the
Lord, following the rite chosen for Communion from the chalice, as has been
remarked above.</p>

<p class="girm">The Communion of the Deacon and the purification of the chalice
take place as described above.</p>

<p class="girm">249. If the concelebrants’ Communion is by intinction, the
principal cele-brant partakes of the Body and Blood of the Lord in the usual
way, but making sure that enough of the precious Blood remains in the chalice
for the Communion of the concelebrants. Then the Deacon, or one of the
concelebrants, arranges the chalice together with the paten containing
particles of the host, if appropriate, either in the center of the altar or at
the side on another corporal.</p>

<p class="girm">The concelebrants approach the altar one by one, genuflect, and
take a particle, intinct it partly into the chalice, and, holding a purificator
under their mouth, consume the intincted particle. They then return to their
places as at the beginning of Mass.</p>

<p class="girm">The Deacon also receives Communion by intinction and to the
concelebrant’s words, Corpus et Sanguis Christi (The Body and Blood of Christ)
replies, Amen. Moreover, the Deacon consumes at the altar all that remains of
the Precious Blood, assisted, if the case requires, by some of the
concele-brants. He carries the chalice to the credence table and there he or a
duly instituted acolyte purifies it, wipes it, and arranges it as usual.</p>

<h4 class="calibre5">The Concluding Rites</h4>

<p class="girm">250. Everything else until the end of Mass is done by the
principal celebrant in the usual way (cf. nos. 166-168), with the other
concelebrants remaining at their seats.</p>

<p class="girm">251. Before leaving the altar, the concelebrants make a profound
bow to the altar. For his part the principal celebrant, along with the Deacon,
venerates the altar as usual with a kiss.</p>
