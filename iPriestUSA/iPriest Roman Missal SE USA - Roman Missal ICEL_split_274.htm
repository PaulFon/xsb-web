<h3 class="calibre2">The victory of the Passion</h3>

<p class="rubric">44. The following Preface is
said on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday of Holy Week. </p>

<p class="calibre6">The Lord be with you.</p>

<p class="response">And with your spirit.</p>

<p class="calibre6">Lift up your hearts.</p>

<p class="response">We lift them up to the Lord.</p>

<p class="calibre6">Let us give thanks to the Lord our God.</p>

<p class="response">It is right and just.</p>

<p class="calibre6">It is truly right and just, our duty and our
salvation, always and everywhere to give you thanks, Lord, holy Father, almighty
and eternal God, through Christ our Lord. </p>

<p class="calibre6">For the days of his saving Passion and
glorious Resurrection are approaching, by which the pride of the ancient foe is
vanquished and the mystery of our redemption in Christ is celebrated. </p>

<p class="calibre6">Through him the host of Angels adores your
majesty and rejoices in your presence for ever. <br class="wordsection"/>
May our voices, we pray, join with theirs in one chorus of exultant praise, as
we acclaim: </p>

<p class="all">Holy, Holy, Holy Lord God of hosts.
Heaven and earth are full of your glory. Hosanna in the highest. Blessed is he
who comes in the name of the Lord. Hosanna in the highest.</p>
