<p class="calibre6">O God, who have willed that your Priests<br class="wordsection"/>
should minister at the holy altar and serve your people, <br class="wordsection"/>
grant by the power of this sacrifice, we pray,<br class="wordsection"/>
that the labors of your servants <br class="wordsection"/>
may constantly please you <br class="wordsection"/>
and in your Church bear that fruit which lasts for ever. </p>

<p class="calibre6">Through Christ our Lord.</p>

<h3 class="calibre2">Preface: The Priesthood of Christ and the ministry of Priests.</h3>

<p class="calibre6">The Lord be with you.</p>

<p class="response">And with your spirit.</p>

<p class="calibre6">Lift up your hearts.</p>

<p class="response">We lift them up to the Lord.</p>

<p class="calibre6">Let us give thanks to the Lord our God.</p>

<p class="response">It is right and just.</p>

<p class="calibre6">It is truly right and just, our duty and our
salvation, <br class="wordsection"/>
always and everywhere to give you thanks,<br class="wordsection"/>
Lord, holy Father, almighty and eternal God.</p>

<p class="calibre6">For by the anointing of the Holy Spirit<br class="wordsection"/>
you constituted your Only Begotten Son<br class="wordsection"/>
High Priest of the new and eternal covenant,<br class="wordsection"/>
and by your wondrous plan were pleased to decree <br class="wordsection"/>
that his one Priesthood should continue in the Church.<br class="wordsection"/>
For Christ not only adorns with a royal priesthood <br class="wordsection"/>
the people he has made his own,<br class="wordsection"/>
but with a brother’s goodness <br class="wordsection"/>
he also chooses men to become sharers in his sacred ministry<br class="wordsection"/>
through the laying on of hands.</p>

<p class="calibre6">They are to renew in his Name<br class="wordsection"/>
the sacrifice of human redemption,<br class="wordsection"/>
to set before your children the paschal banquet, <br class="wordsection"/>
to lead your holy people in charity,<br class="wordsection"/>
to nourish them with your word,<br class="wordsection"/>
and to strengthen them with the Sacraments.</p>

<p class="calibre6">As they give up their lives for you<br class="wordsection"/>
and for the salvation of their brothers and sisters,<br class="wordsection"/>
they strive to be conformed to the image of Christ himself, <br class="wordsection"/>
and offer you a constant witness of faith and love.</p>

<p class="calibre6">And so, Lord, with all the Angels and Saints,<br class="wordsection"/>
we, too, give you thanks as in exultation we acclaim:</p>

<p class="all">Holy, Holy, Holy Lord God of hosts.
Heaven and earth are full of your glory. Hosanna in the highest. Blessed is he
who comes in the name of the Lord. Hosanna in the highest.</p>

Priest in the Eucharistic Prayers is made according to the following formulas:</p>

that of your whole family, which we make to you<br class="wordsection"/>
also for this your servant,<br class="wordsection"/>
whom you have been pleased to raise to the Order of Priesthood;<br class="wordsection"/>
in your mercy, we pray, keep safe your gifts in him,<br class="wordsection"/>

this your servant,<br class="wordsection"/>
whom today you have been pleased to choose <br class="wordsection"/>
