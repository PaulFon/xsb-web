<p class="calibre6">Let us pray.</p>

<p class="rubric">And all pray in silence with the
Priest for a while.</p>

<p class="calibre6">O God, who willed that Saint John the Baptist<br class="wordsection"/>
should go ahead of your Son<br class="wordsection"/>
both in his birth and in his death,<br class="wordsection"/>
grant that, as he died a Martyr for truth and justice, <br class="wordsection"/>
we, too, may fight hard<br class="wordsection"/>
for the confession of what you teach.</p>

<p class="calibre6">Through our Lord Jesus Christ, your Son,<br class="wordsection"/>
who lives and reigns with you <br class="wordsection"/>
in the unity of the Holy Spirit, one God, for ever and ever.</p>

<h3 class="calibre2">Prayer over the Offerings</h3>

<p class="calibre6">Through these offerings which we bring you, O
Lord, <br class="wordsection"/>
grant that we may make straight your paths,<br class="wordsection"/>
as taught by that voice crying in the desert,<br class="wordsection"/>
Saint John the Baptist,<br class="wordsection"/>
who powerfully sealed his teaching<br class="wordsection"/>
by the shedding of his blood.</p>

<p class="calibre6">Through Christ our Lord.</p>

<h3 class="calibre2">Preface: The mission of the Precursor.</h3>

<p class="calibre6">The Lord be with you.</p>

<p class="response">And with your spirit.</p>

<p class="calibre6">Lift up your hearts.</p>

<p class="response">We lift them up to the Lord.</p>

<p class="calibre6">Let us give thanks to the Lord our God.</p>

<p class="response">It is right and just.</p>

<p class="calibre6">It is truly right and just, our duty and our
salvation, <br class="wordsection"/>
always and everywhere to give you thanks,<br class="wordsection"/>
Lord, holy Father, almighty and eternal God, <br class="wordsection"/>
through Christ our Lord.</p>

<p class="calibre6">In his Precursor, Saint John the Baptist, <br class="wordsection"/>
we praise your great glory,<br class="wordsection"/>
for you consecrated him for a singular honour <br class="wordsection"/>
among those born of women.</p>

<p class="calibre6">His birth brought great rejoicing; <br class="wordsection"/>
even in the womb he leapt for joy <br class="wordsection"/>
at the coming of human salvation. <br class="wordsection"/>
He alone of all the prophets<br class="wordsection"/>
pointed out the Lamb of redemption.</p>

<p class="calibre6">And to make holy the flowing waters,<br class="wordsection"/>
he baptised the very author of Baptism<br class="wordsection"/>
and was privileged to bear him supreme witness <br class="wordsection"/>
by the shedding of his blood.</p>

<p class="calibre6">And so, with the Powers of heaven, <br class="wordsection"/>
we worship you constantly on earth, <br class="wordsection"/>
and before your majesty<br class="wordsection"/>
without end we acclaim:</p>

<p class="all">Holy, Holy, Holy Lord God of hosts.
Heaven and earth are full of your glory. Hosanna in the highest. Blessed is he
who comes in the name of the Lord. Hosanna in the highest.</p>

<h3 class="calibre2">Prayer after Communion</h3>

<p class="calibre6">Grant, O Lord,<br class="wordsection"/>
as we celebrate the heavenly birth of Saint John the Baptist, <br class="wordsection"/>
that we may revere, for what it signifies,<br class="wordsection"/>
the saving Sacrament we have received<br class="wordsection"/>
and, even more, may rejoice<br class="wordsection"/>
at its clear effects in us.</p>

<p class="calibre6">Through Christ our Lord.</p>
