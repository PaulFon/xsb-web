<h2 id="calibre_toc_881" class="calibre10">Chapter VII: The Choice of the Mass and Its Parts</h2>

<p class="girm">352. The pastoral effectiveness of a celebration will be greatly
increased if the texts of the readings, the prayers, and the liturgical chants
correspond as aptly as possible to the needs, the preparation, and the culture
of the participants. This will be achieved by appropriate use of the many
possibilities of choice described below.</p>

<p class="girm">Hence in arranging the celebration of Mass, the Priest should be
attentive rather to the common spiritual good of the People of God than to his
own inclinations. He should also remember that choices of this kind are to be
made in harmony with those who exercise some part in the celebration, including
the faithful, as regards the parts that more directly pertain to them.</p>

<p class="girm">Since, indeed, many possibilities are provided for choosing the
different parts of the Mass, it is necessary for the Deacon, the readers, the
psalmist, the cantor, the commentator, and the choir to know properly before
the celebration the texts that concern each and that are to be used, and it is
necessary that nothing be in any sense improvised. For harmonious ordering and
carrying out of the rites will greatly help in disposing the faithful for
participation in the Eucharist.</p>

<h5 class="calibre31">I. The Choice of Mass</h5>

<p class="girm">353. On Solemnities the Priest is obliged to follow the Calendar
of the church where he is celebrating.</p>

<p class="girm">354. On Sundays, on the weekdays during Advent, Christmas Time,
Lent, and Easter Time, on Feasts, and on Obligatory Memorials:</p>

<p class="girm">a) If Mass is celebrated with the people, the Priest should
follow the Calendar of the church where he is celebrating;</p>

<p class="girm">b) If Mass is celebrated with the participation of one minister
only, the Priest may choose either the Calendar of the church or his proper
Calendar.</p>

<p class="girm">355. On Optional Memorials,</p>

<p class="girm">a) On the weekdays of Advent from December 17 to December 24, on
days within the Octave of the Nativity of the Lord, and on the weekdays of
Lent, except Ash Wednesday and during Holy Week, the Mass texts for the current
liturgical day are used; but the Collect may be taken from a Memorial which
happens to be inscribed in the General Calendar for that day, except on Ash
Wednesday and during Holy Week. On weekdays of Easter Time, Memorials of Saints
may rightly be celebrated in full.</p>

<p class="girm">b) On weekdays of Advent before December 17, on weekdays of
Christmas Time from January 2, and on weekdays of Easter Time, one of the
following may be chosen: either the Mass of the weekday, or the Mass of the
Saint or of one of the Saints whose Memorial is observed, or the Mass of any
Saint inscribed in the Martyrology for that day.</p>

<p class="girm">c) On weekdays in Ordinary Time, there may be chosen either the
Mass of the weekday, or the Mass of an Optional Memorial which happens to occur
on that day, or the Mass of any Saint inscribed in the Martyrology for that
day, or a Mass for Various Needs, or a Votive Mass.</p>

<p class="girm">If he celebrates with the people, the Priest will take care not
to omit too frequently and without sufficient reason the readings assigned each
day in the Lectionary to the weekdays, for the Church desires that a richer
portion at the table of God’s Word should be spread before the people.<a href="iPriest%20Roman%20Missal%20SE%20USA%20-%20Roman%20Missal%20ICEL_split_884.htm#fn-140"> [140]</a><a id="fn-140-bl"></a></p>

<p class="girm">For the same reason he should choose Masses for the Dead in
moderation, for every Mass is offered for both the living and the dead, and
there is a commemoration of the dead in the Eucharistic Prayer.</p>

<p class="girm">Where, however, the Optional Memorials of the Blessed Virgin Mary
or of the Saints are dear to the faithful, the legitimate devotion of the
latter should be satisfied.</p>

<p class="girm">Moreover, as regards the option of choosing between a Memorial
inscribed in the General Calendar and one inserted in a diocesan or religious
Calendar, preference should be given, all else being equal and in keeping with
tradition, to the Memorial in the particular Calendar.</p>

<h5 class="calibre31">II. The Choice of Texts for the Mass</h5>

<p class="girm">356. In choosing texts for the different parts of the Mass,
whether for the time of the year or for Saints, the norms that follow should be
observed.</p>

<h4 class="calibre5">The Readings</h4>

<p class="girm">357. Sundays and Solemnities have assigned to them three
readings, that is, from a Prophet, an Apostle, and a Gospel, by which the
Christian people are instructed in the continuity of the work of salvation
according to God’s wonderful design. These readings should be followed
strictly. In Easter Time, according to the tradition of the Church, instead of
being from the Old Testament, the reading is taken from the Acts of the
Apostles.</p>

<p class="girm">For Feasts, two readings are assigned. If, however, according to
the norms a Feast is raised to the rank of a Solemnity, a third reading is
added, and this is taken from the Common.</p>

<p class="girm">For Memorials of Saints, unless proper readings are given, the
readings assigned for the weekday are normally used. In certain cases,
particularized readings are provided, that is to say, readings which highlight
some particular aspect of the spiritual life or activity of the Saint. The use
of such readings is not to be insisted upon, unless a pastoral reason truly
suggests it.</p>

<p class="girm">358. In the Lectionary for weekdays, readings are provided for
each day of every week throughout the entire course of the year; hence, these
readings will in general be used on the days to which they are assigned, unless
there occurs a Solemnity, a Feast, or Memorial that has its own New Testament
readings, that is to say, readings in which mention is made of the Saint being
celebrated.</p>

<p class="girm">Should, however, the continuous reading during the week from time
to time be interrupted, on account of some Solemnity or Feast, or some
particular celebration, then the Priest shall be permitted, bearing in mind the
scheme of readings for the entire week, either to combine parts omitted with
other readings or to decide which readings are to be given preference over
others.</p>

<p class="girm">In Masses for special groups, the Priest shall be allowed to
choose texts more particularly suited to the particular celebration, provided
they are taken from the texts of an approved Lectionary.</p>

<p class="girm">359. In addition, in the Lectionary a special selection of texts
from Sacred Scripture is given for Ritual Masses into which certain Sacraments
or Sacramentals are incorporated, or for Masses that are celebrated for certain
needs.</p>

<p class="girm">Sets of readings of this kind have been so prescribed so that
through a more apt hearing of the Word of God the faithful may be led to a
fuller understanding of the mystery in which they are participating, and may be
educated to a more ardent love of the Word of God.</p>

<p class="girm">Therefore, the texts proclaimed in the celebration are to be
chosen keeping in mind both an appropriate pastoral reason and the options
allowed in this matter.</p>

<p class="girm">360. At times, a longer and shorter form of the same text is
given. In choosing between these two forms, a pastoral criterion should be kept
in mind. On such an occasion, attention should be paid to the capacity of the
faithful to listen with fruit to a reading of greater or lesser length, and to
their capacity to hear a more complete text, which is then explained in the
Homily.<a href="iPriest%20Roman%20Missal%20SE%20USA%20-%20Roman%20Missal%20ICEL_split_884.htm#fn-141"> [141]</a><a id="fn-141-bl"></a></p>

<p class="girm">361. When a possibility is given of choosing between one or other
text laid down, or suggested as optional, attention shall be paid to the good
of participants, whether, that is to say, it is a matter of using an easier
text or one more appropriate for a given gathering, or of repeating or setting
aside a text that is assigned as proper to some particular celebration while
being optional for another,<a href="iPriest%20Roman%20Missal%20SE%20USA%20-%20Roman%20Missal%20ICEL_split_884.htm#fn-142"> [142]</a><a id="fn-142-bl"></a>
just as pastoral advantage may suggest.</p>

<p class="girm">Such a situation may arise either when the same text would have
to be read again within a few days, as, for example, on a Sunday and on a
subsequent weekday, or when it is feared that a certain text might give rise to
some difficulties for a particular group of the Christian faithful. However,
care should be taken that, when choosing scriptural passages, parts of Sacred
Scripture are not permanently excluded.</p>

<p class="girm">362. The adaptations to the Ordo Lectionum Missae as contained in
the Lectionary for Mass for use in the Dioceses of the United States of America
should be carefully observed.</p>

<h4 class="calibre5">The Orations</h4>

<p class="girm">363. In any Mass the orations proper to that Mass are used,
unless otherwise noted.</p>

<p class="girm">On Memorials of Saints, the proper Collect is said or, if this is
lacking, one from an appropriate Common. As to the Prayer over the Offerings
and the Prayer after Communion, unless these are proper, they may be taken
either from the Common or from the weekday of the current time of year.</p>

<p class="girm">On the weekdays in Ordinary Time, however, besides the orations
from the previous Sunday, orations from another Sunday in Ordinary Time may be
used, or one of the Prayers for Various Needs provided in the Missal. However,
it shall always be permissible to use from these Masses the Collect alone.</p>

<p class="girm">In this way a richer collection of texts is provided, by which
the prayer life of the faithful is more abundantly nourished.</p>

<p class="girm">However, during the more important times of the year, provision
has already been made for this by means of the orations proper to these times
of the year that exist for each weekday in the Missal.</p>

<h4 class="calibre5">The Eucharistic Prayer</h4>

<p class="girm">364. The numerous Prefaces with which the Roman Missal is endowed
have as their purpose to bring out more fully the motives for thanksgiving
within the Eucharistic Prayer and to set out more clearly the different facets
of the mystery of salvation.</p>

<p class="girm">365. The choice between the Eucharistic Prayers found in the
Order of Mass is suitably guided by the following norms:</p>

<p class="girm">a) Eucharistic Prayer I, or the Roman Canon, which may always be
used, is especially suited for use on days to which a proper text for the
Communicantes (In communion with those whose memory we venerate) is assigned or
in Masses endowed with a proper form of the Hanc igitur (Therefore, Lord, we
pray) and also in the celebrations of the Apostles and of the Saints mentioned
in the Prayer itself; likewise it is especially suited for use on Sundays,
unless for pastoral reasons Eucharistic Prayer III is preferred.</p>

<p class="girm">b) Eucharistic Prayer II, on account of its particular features,
is more appropriately used on weekdays or in special circumstances. Although it
is provided with its own Preface, it may also be used with other Prefaces,
especially those that sum up the mystery of salvation, for example, the Common
Prefaces. When Mass is celebrated for a particular deceased person, the special
formula given may be used at the proper point, namely, before the part Remember
also our brothers and sisters.</p>

<p class="girm">c) Eucharistic Prayer III may be said with any Preface. Its use
should be preferred on Sundays and festive days. If, however, this Eucharistic
Prayer is used in Masses for the Dead, the special formula for a deceased
person may be used, to be included at the proper place, namely after the words:
in your compassion, O merciful Father, gather to yourself all your children
scattered throughout the world.</p>

<p class="girm">d) Eucharistic Prayer IV has an invariable Preface and gives a
fuller summary of salvation history. It may be used when a Mass has no Preface
of its own and on Sundays in Ordinary Time. On account of its structure, no
special formula for a deceased person may be inserted into this prayer.</p>

<h4 class="calibre5">The Chants</h4>

<p class="girm">366. It is not permitted to substitute other chants for those
found in the Order of Mass, for example, at the Agnus Dei (Lamb of God).</p>

<p class="girm">367. In choosing the chants between the readings, as well as the
chants at the Entrance, at the Offertory, and at Communion, the norms laid down
in their proper places are to be observed (cf. nos. 40-41, 47-48, 61-64, 74,
86-88).</p>
