<p class="calibre6">The Lord be with you.</p>

<p class="response">And with your spirit.</p>

<p class="calibre6">Lift up your hearts.</p>

<p class="response">We lift them up to the Lord.</p>

<p class="calibre6">Let us give thanks to the Lord our God.</p>

<p class="response">It is right and just.</p>

<p class="calibre6">God our Father,<br class="wordsection"/>
you have brought us here together<br class="wordsection"/>
so that we can give you thanks and praise<br class="wordsection"/>
for all the wonderful things you have done.<br class="wordsection"/>
We thank you for all that is beautiful in the world<br class="wordsection"/>
and for the happiness you have given us.<br class="wordsection"/>
We praise you for daylight<br class="wordsection"/>
and for your word which lights up our minds.</p>

<p class="calibre6">We praise you for the earth<br class="wordsection"/>
and for all the people who live on it,<br class="wordsection"/>
and for our life which comes from you.<br class="wordsection"/>
We know that you are good.<br class="wordsection"/>
You love us and do great things for us.</p>

<p class="quietly">[So we all sing (say) together:<br class="wordsection"/>
Holy, Holy, Holy Lord God of hosts.<br class="wordsection"/>
Heaven and earth are full of your glory.<br class="wordsection"/>
Hosanna in the highest.]</p>

<p class="rubric"><img border="0" id="_x0000_i1093" src="pc.gif" class="calibre12"/>The
Priest, with hands extended, says:</p>

<p class="calibre6">Father,<br class="wordsection"/>
you are always thinking about your people;<br class="wordsection"/>
you never forget us.</p>

<p class="calibre6">You sent us your Son Jesus,<br class="wordsection"/>
who gave his life for us<br class="wordsection"/>
and who came to save us.<br class="wordsection"/>
He cured sick people;<br class="wordsection"/>
he cared for those who were poor<br class="wordsection"/>
and wept with those who were sad.<br class="wordsection"/>
He forgave sinners<br class="wordsection"/>
and taught us to forgive each other.</p>

<p class="calibre6">He loved everyone and showed us how to be
kind. <br class="wordsection"/>
He took children in his arms and blessed them.</p>

<p class="quietly">[So we are glad to sing (say):<br class="wordsection"/>
Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord.<br class="wordsection"/>
Hosanna in the highest.]</p>

<p class="rubric"><img border="0" id="_x0000_i1092" src="pc.gif" class="calibre12"/>The
Priest, with hands extended, says:</p>

<p class="calibre6">God our Father,<br class="wordsection"/>
all over the world your people praise you.<br class="wordsection"/>
So now we pray with the whole Church:<br class="wordsection"/>
with <span class="red1">Francis</span>, our pope and <span class="red1">N.</span>, our bishop.<br class="wordsection"/>
In heaven the blessed Virgin Mary,<br class="wordsection"/>
the apostles and all the saints<br class="wordsection"/>
always sing your praise.</p>

<p class="calibre6">Now we join with them and with the angels<br class="wordsection"/>
to adore you as we sing <span class="opt">(say):</span></p>

<p class="all">Holy, Holy, Holy Lord God of hosts.<br class="wordsection"/>
Heaven and earth are full of your glory.<br class="wordsection"/>
Hosanna in the highest.<br class="wordsection"/>
Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord.<br class="wordsection"/>
Hosanna in the highest.</p>

<p class="rubric"><img border="0" id="_x0000_i1091" src="cc.gif" class="calibre12"/>The
Priest, with hands extended, says:</p>

<p class="calibre6">God our Father,<br class="wordsection"/>
you are most holy<br class="wordsection"/>
and we want to show you that we are grateful.<br class="wordsection"/>
We bring you bread and wine<br class="wordsection"/>
and ask you to send your Holy Spirit to make these gifts<br class="wordsection"/>
the body and blood + of Jesus your Son.</p>

<p class="calibre6">Then we can offer to you<br class="wordsection"/>
what you have given to us.</p>

<p class="calibre6">On the night before he died,<br class="wordsection"/>
Jesus was having supper with his Apostles. <br class="wordsection"/>
He took bread from the table.<br class="wordsection"/>
He gave you thanks and praise.<br class="wordsection"/>
Then he broke the bread, gave it to his friends, and said:</p>

<p class="calibre6">TAKE THIS, ALL OF YOU, AND EAT OF IT, <br class="wordsection"/>
FOR THIS IS MY BODY, WHICH WILL BE GIVEN UP FOR YOU.</p>

<p class="calibre6">When supper was ended, <br class="wordsection"/>
Jesus took the chalice that was filled with wine.<br class="wordsection"/>
He thanked you, gave it to his friends, and said:</p>

<p class="calibre6">TAKE THIS, ALL OF YOU, AND DRINK FROM IT, <br class="wordsection"/>
FOR THIS IS THE CHALICE OF MY BLOOD, <br class="wordsection"/>
THE BLOOD OF THE NEW AND ETERNAL COVENANT, <br class="wordsection"/>
WHICH WILL BE POURED OUT FOR YOU <br class="wordsection"/>
AND FOR MANY FOR THE FORGIVENESS OF SINS. </p>

<p class="calibre6">Then he said to them:<br class="wordsection"/>
DO THIS IN MEMORY OF ME.</p>

<p class="calibre6"><img border="0" id="_x0000_i1090" src="cc.gif" class="calibre12"/>We do now
what Jesus told us to do.<br class="wordsection"/>
We remember his Death and his Resurrection<br class="wordsection"/>
and we offer you, Father, the bread that gives us life,<br class="wordsection"/>
and the cup that saves us.<br class="wordsection"/>
Jesus brings us to you;<br class="wordsection"/>
welcome us as you welcome him.</p>

<p class="calibre6">The mystery of faith:</p>

<p class="response">We proclaim your Death, O
Lord, <br class="wordsection"/>
and profess your Resurrection until you come again. </p>

<p class="rubric">Or:</p>

<p class="response">When we eat this Bread and
drink this Cup, <br class="wordsection"/>
we proclaim your Death, O Lord, until you come again. </p>

<p class="rubric">or: </p>

<p class="response">Save us, Saviour of the world,
<br class="wordsection"/>
for by your Cross and Resurrection you have set us free. </p>

<p class="rubric"><img border="0" id="_x0000_i1089" src="c1.gif" class="calibre12"/>The
Priest, with hands extended, says:</p>

<p class="calibre6">Father, because you love us,<br class="wordsection"/>
you invite us to come to your table.<br class="wordsection"/>
Fill us with the joy of the Holy Spirit<br class="wordsection"/>
as we receive the body and blood of your Son.<br class="wordsection"/>
Lord, you never forget any of your children.<br class="wordsection"/>
We ask you to take care of those we love,<br class="wordsection"/>
especially of N. and N.,<br class="wordsection"/>
and we pray for those who have died.</p>

<p class="calibre6"><img border="0" id="_x0000_i1088" src="c2.gif" class="calibre12"/>Remember
everyone who is suffering from pain or sorrow.<br class="wordsection"/>
Remember Christians everywhere<br class="wordsection"/>
and all other people in the world.</p>

<p class="calibre6">We are filled with wonder and praise<br class="wordsection"/>
when we see what you do for us<br class="wordsection"/>
through Jesus your Son,<br class="wordsection"/>
and so we give you praise.</p>

<p class="rubric"><img border="0" id="_x0000_i1087" src="pcc.gif" class="calibre12"/>He
joins his hands, takes the chalice and the paten with the host and, raising
both, he says: </p>

<p class="calibre6">Through him, and with him, and in him, <br class="wordsection"/>
O God, almighty Father, <br class="wordsection"/>
in the unity of the Holy Spirit, <br class="wordsection"/>
all glory and honour is yours, <br class="wordsection"/>
for ever and ever.</p>
