ORDINARY TIME </h2>

<h3 class="calibre2">Creation</h3>

<p class="rubric">56. The following Preface is
said on Sundays in Ordinary Time. </p>

<p class="calibre6">The Lord be with you.</p>

<p class="response">And with your spirit.</p>

<p class="calibre6">Lift up your hearts.</p>

<p class="response">We lift them up to the Lord.</p>

<p class="calibre6">Let us give thanks to the Lord our God.</p>

<p class="response">It is right and just.</p>

<p class="calibre6">It is truly right and just, our duty and our
salvation, always and everywhere to give you thanks, Lord, holy Father, almighty
and eternal God. </p>

<p class="calibre6">For you laid the foundations of the world and
have arranged the changing of times and seasons; you formed man in your own
image and set humanity over the whole world in all its wonder, to rule in your
name over all you have made and for ever praise you in your mighty works,
through Christ our Lord. </p>

<p class="calibre6">And so, with all the Angels, we praise you,
as in joyful celebration we acclaim: </p>

<p class="all">Holy, Holy, Holy Lord God of hosts.
Heaven and earth are full of your glory. Hosanna in the highest. Blessed is he
who comes in the name of the Lord. Hosanna in the highest.</p>
