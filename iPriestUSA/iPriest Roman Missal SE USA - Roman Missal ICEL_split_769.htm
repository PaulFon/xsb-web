<h4 class="calibre5">The Preface of Religious Life may be said.</h4>

<h3 class="calibre2">Preface: Religious life as service of God through the imitation of Christ.</h3>

<p class="calibre6">The Lord be with you.</p>

<p class="response">And with your spirit.</p>

<p class="calibre6">Lift up your hearts.</p>

<p class="response">We lift them up to the Lord.</p>

<p class="calibre6">Let us give thanks to the Lord our God.</p>

<p class="response">It is right and just.</p>

<p class="calibre6">It is truly right and just, our duty and our
salvation, <br class="wordsection"/>
always and everywhere to give you thanks,<br class="wordsection"/>
Lord, holy Father, almighty and eternal God, <br class="wordsection"/>
through Christ our Lord.</p>

<p class="calibre6">He is the unblemished flower,<br class="wordsection"/>
who sprang from the root of the Virgin <br class="wordsection"/>
and declared the pure of heart blessed,<br class="wordsection"/>
teaching by his way of life the surpassing worth of chastity.</p>

<p class="calibre6">He chose always to hold fast to what is
pleasing to you <br class="wordsection"/>
and becoming obedient for our sake even until death, <br class="wordsection"/>
he willingly offered himself to you<br class="wordsection"/>
as a perfect and a fragrant sacrifice.</p>

<p class="calibre6">He consecrated to a fuller service of your
majesty <br class="wordsection"/>
those who for love of you leave all earthly things <br class="wordsection"/>
and promised they would find treasure in heaven.</p>

<p class="calibre6">And so, with the company of Angels and
Saints, <br class="wordsection"/>
as we sing the hymn of your praise,<br class="wordsection"/>
without end we acclaim:</p>

<p class="all">Holy, Holy, Holy Lord God of hosts.
Heaven and earth are full of your glory. Hosanna in the highest. Blessed is he
who comes in the name of the Lord. Hosanna in the highest.</p>

<p class="rubric">The commemoration of the
consecrated virgins in the Eucharistic Prayers takes place according to the

<p class="rubric">a) In Eucharistic Prayer I, the
proper form of Hanc igitur (Therefore, Lord, we pray) is said:</p>

<p class="calibre6">Therefore, Lord, we pray:<br class="wordsection"/>
graciously accept this oblation of our service,<br class="wordsection"/>
and of these your servants,<br class="wordsection"/>
which we make to you on their day of consecration; <br class="wordsection"/>
sanctify this offering in your mercy,<br class="wordsection"/>
so that they who by your gift<br class="wordsection"/>
have today united themselves more closely to your Son <br class="wordsection"/>
may hasten gladly to meet him<br class="wordsection"/>
when he comes in glory at the end of time.</p>

<p class="quietly"><span class="red1"><span class="calibre14">(</span></span>Through
Christ our Lord. Amen.<span class="red1"><span class="calibre14">)</span></span> </p>

<p class="rubric">b) In the intercessions of
Eucharistic Prayer II, after the words and all the clergy, the following is
added:</p>

<p class="calibre6">Be mindful also, Lord, of these sisters,<br class="wordsection"/>
whom you have consecrated today by a spiritual anointing so that, <br class="wordsection"/>
with lighted lamps of charity and faith,<br class="wordsection"/>
they may constantly serve you and your people<br class="wordsection"/>
as they await the advent of Christ the Bridegroom. </p>

<p class="calibre6">Remember also our brothers and sisters ...</p>

<p class="rubric">c) In the intercessions of
Eucharistic Prayer III, after the words the entire people you have gained for
your own, the following is added:</p>

<p class="calibre6">Strengthen in their holy resolve, O Lord,<br class="wordsection"/>
these your servants,<br class="wordsection"/>
who seek to follow your Christ in faithful devotion,<br class="wordsection"/>
giving a witness of evangelical life<br class="wordsection"/>
and of sisterly love.</p>

<p class="calibre6">Listen graciously to the prayers of this
family ...</p>

<p class="rubric">d) If the proper Preface is not
used, Eucharistic Prayer IV may be said; in its intercession, after the words
to the praise of your glory, mention of the consecrated may be inserted in this
way:</p>

<p class="calibre6">Therefore, Lord, remember now<br class="wordsection"/>
all for whom we offer you this sacrifice:<br class="wordsection"/>
especially your servant, <span class="red1">Francis</span> our Pope<br class="wordsection"/>
and <span class="red1">N.</span> our Bishop,<br class="wordsection"/>
with the whole Order of Bishops,<br class="wordsection"/>
and all the clergy.</p>

<p class="calibre6">Be mindful also of these sisters,<br class="wordsection"/>
whom you have dedicated today in perpetuity<br class="wordsection"/>
to divine worship and the service of humanity,<br class="wordsection"/>
those who take part in this offering,<br class="wordsection"/>
those gathered here before you,<br class="wordsection"/>
your entire people,<br class="wordsection"/>
and all who seek you with a sincere heart.</p>

<p class="calibre6">Remember also<br class="wordsection"/>
those who have died in the peace of your Christ ...</p>

<p class="anth">Communion Antiphon | Ps 41:2</p>

<p class="ant">Like the deer that yearns for
running streams, so my soul is yearning for you, O God (alleluia).</p>

<h3 class="calibre2">Prayer after Communion</h3>

<p class="calibre6">Replenished by these sacred gifts, O Lord,<br class="wordsection"/>
we humbly pray<br class="wordsection"/>
that the way of life chosen by your servants <span class="red1">N.</span> and <span class="red1">N.</span> <br class="wordsection"/>
may constantly benefit<br class="wordsection"/>
the advancement of human society<br class="wordsection"/>
and unceasingly profit the growth of the Church.</p>

<p class="calibre6">Through Christ our Lord.</p>
