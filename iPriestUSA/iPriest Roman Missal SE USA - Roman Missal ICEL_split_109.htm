<h2 id="calibre_toc_151" class="calibre10">The Chrism Mass</h2>

<p class="rubric">The blessing of the Oil of the Sick and of the Oil of Catechumens and the consecration of the Chrism are carried out by the Bishop,
according to the Rite described in the Roman Pontifical, usually on this day,
at a proper Mass to be celebrated during the morning.<br class="wordsection"/>
If, however, it is very difficult for the clergy and the people to gather with
the Bishop on this day, the Chrism Mass may be anticipated on another day, but
near to Easter.</p>

<p class="rubric">This Mass, which the Bishop concelebrates with his
presbyterate, should be, as it were, a manifestation of the Priests’ communion
with their Bishop. Accordingly it is desirable that all the Priests participate
in it, insofar as is possible, and during it receive Communion even under both
kinds. To signify the unity of the presbyterate of the diocese, the Priests who
concelebrate with the Bishop should be from different regions of the diocese.</p>

<p class="rubric">In accord with traditional practice, the blessing of the Oil of the Sick takes place before the end of the Eucharistic Prayer, but the blessing
of the Oil of Catechumens and the consecration of the Chrism take place after
Communion. Nevertheless, for pastoral reasons, it is permitted for the entire
rite of blessing to take place after the Liturgy of the Word.</p>

is said.</p>

<h3 class="calibre2">Collect</h3>

<p class="calibre6">Let us pray.</p>

<p class="rubric">And all pray in silence with the Priest for a while.</p>

<p class="calibre6">O God, who anointed your Only Begotten Son <br class="wordsection"/>
with the Holy Spirit and made him Christ and Lord,<br class="wordsection"/>
graciously grant that, being made sharers in his consecration,<br class="wordsection"/>
we may bear witness to your Redemption in the world.</p>

<p class="calibre6">Through our Lord Jesus Christ, your Son,<br class="wordsection"/>
who lives and reigns with you in the unity of the Holy Spirit, <br class="wordsection"/>
one God, for ever and ever.</p>

<p class="rubric">After the reading of the Gospel, the Bishop preaches the Homily
in which, taking his starting point from the text of the readings proclaimed in
the Liturgy of the Word, he speaks to the people and to his Priests about
priestly anointing, urging the Priests to be faithful in their office and
calling on them to renew publicly their priestly promises.</p>

<h3 class="calibre2">Renewal of Priestly Promises</h3>

<p class="rubric">After the Homily, the Bishop speaks with the Priests in these
or similar words.</p>

<p class="calibre6">Beloved sons,<br class="wordsection"/>
on the anniversary of that day<br class="wordsection"/>
when Christ our Lord conferred his priesthood <br class="wordsection"/>
on his Apostles and on us,<br class="wordsection"/>
are you resolved to renew in the presence of your Bishop <br class="wordsection"/>
and God’s holy people, the promises you once made?</p>

<p class="rubric">The Priests, all together, respond: </p>

<p class="response">I am.</p>

<p class="calibre6">Are you resolved to be more united with the Lord Jesus <br class="wordsection"/>
and more closely conformed to him,<br class="wordsection"/>
denying yourselves and confirming those promises <br class="wordsection"/>
about sacred duties towards Christ’s Church<br class="wordsection"/>
which, prompted by love of him,<br class="wordsection"/>
you willingly and joyfully pledged<br class="wordsection"/>
on the day of your priestly ordination?</p>

<p class="response">Priests: I am.</p>

<p class="calibre6">Are you resolved to be faithful stewards of the mysteries of God <br class="wordsection"/>
in the Holy Eucharist and the other liturgical rites<br class="wordsection"/>
and to discharge faithfully the sacred office of teaching, <br class="wordsection"/>
following Christ the Head and Shepherd,<br class="wordsection"/>
not seeking any gain,<br class="wordsection"/>
but moved only by zeal for souls?</p>

<p class="response">Priests: I am.</p>

<p class="rubric">Then, turned towards the people, the Bishop continues:</p>

<p class="calibre6">As for you, dearest sons and daughters,<br class="wordsection"/>
pray for your Priests,<br class="wordsection"/>
that the Lord may pour out his gifts abundantly upon them, <br class="wordsection"/>
and keep them faithful as ministers of Christ, the High Priest, <br class="wordsection"/>
so that they may lead you to him,<br class="wordsection"/>
who is the source of salvation.</p>

<p class="response">People: Christ, hear us. Christ, graciously hear us.</p>

<p class="calibre6">And pray also for me,<br class="wordsection"/>
that I may be faithful to the apostolic office entrusted to me <br class="wordsection"/>
in my lowliness and that in your midst <br class="wordsection"/>
I may be made day by day a living and more perfect image of Christ,<br class="wordsection"/>
the Priest, the Good Shepherd,<br class="wordsection"/>
the Teacher and the Servant of all.</p>

<p class="response">People: Christ, hear us. Christ, graciously hear us.</p>

<p class="calibre6">May the Lord keep us all in his charity and lead all of us,<br class="wordsection"/>
shepherds and flock,<br class="wordsection"/>
to eternal life.</p>

<p class="response">All: Amen.</p>

<p class="rubric">The Creed is not said.</p>

<p class="response">We lift them up to the Lord.</p>

<p class="calibre6">Let us give thanks to the Lord our God.</p>

<p class="response">It is right and just.</p>

<p class="calibre6">It is truly right and just, <br class="wordsection"/>
our duty and our salvation, <br class="wordsection"/>
always and everywhere to give you thanks,<br class="wordsection"/>
Lord, holy Father, almighty and eternal God.</p>

<p class="calibre6">For by the anointing of the Holy Spirit<br class="wordsection"/>
you made your Only Begotten Son<br class="wordsection"/>
High Priest of the new and eternal covenant,<br class="wordsection"/>
and by your wondrous design were pleased to decree <br class="wordsection"/>
that his one Priesthood should continue in the Church.</p>

<p class="calibre6">For Christ not only adorns with a royal priesthood <br class="wordsection"/>
the people he has made his own,<br class="wordsection"/>
but with a brother’s kindness <br class="wordsection"/>
he also chooses men to become sharers in his sacred ministry<br class="wordsection"/>
through the laying on of hands.</p>

<p class="calibre6">They are to renew in his name<br class="wordsection"/>
the sacrifice of human redemption,<br class="wordsection"/>
to set before your children the paschal banquet, <br class="wordsection"/>
to lead your holy people in charity,<br class="wordsection"/>
to nourish them with the word<br class="wordsection"/>
and strengthen them with the Sacraments.</p>

<p class="calibre6">As they give up their lives for you<br class="wordsection"/>
and for the salvation of their brothers and sisters,<br class="wordsection"/>
they strive to be conformed to the image of Christ himself <br class="wordsection"/>
and offer you a constant witness of faith and love.</p>

<p class="calibre6">And so, Lord, with all the Angels and Saints,<br class="wordsection"/>
we, too, give you thanks as in exultation we acclaim:</p>

<p class="all">Holy, Holy, Holy Lord God of hosts. Heaven and earth are full of your glory. Hosanna in the highest. Blessed is he who comes in the name of the
Lord. Hosanna in the highest.</p>

<p class="calibre6">We beseech you, almighty God,<br class="wordsection"/>
that those you renew by your Sacraments<br class="wordsection"/>
may merit to become the pleasing fragrance of Christ. </p>
