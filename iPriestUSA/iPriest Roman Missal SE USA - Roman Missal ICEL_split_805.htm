Child<br class="calibre4"/>
Who Died before Baptism</h2>

<p class="rubric">Should a child whom the parents
wished to be baptised, die before Baptism, the Diocesan Bishop, taking into consideration
pastoral circumstances, may permit the funeral to be celebrated in the home of
the deceased child, or even according to the form of funeral rites otherwise
customarily used in the region.</p>

<p class="rubric">In funerals of this kind there
should ordinarily be a Liturgy of the Word, as described in the Roman Ritual.
Nevertheless, if at times the celebration of Mass is judged opportune, the
following texts should be used.</p>

<p class="rubric">In catechesis, however, proper
care is to be taken that the doctrine of the necessity of Baptism is not
obscured in the minds of the faithful.</p>

<p class="anth">Entrance Antiphon | Rev 21:4</p>

<p class="ant">God will wipe every tear from their
eyes, and there shall be no more death or mourning, crying or pain, for former
things have passed away.</p>
