<a class="calibre3" id="BAS"></a>ORDER FOR THE BLESSING<br class="calibre4"/>
AND SPRINKLING OF WATER</h2>

<p class="rubric">1. On Sundays, especially in
Easter Time, the blessing and sprinkling of water as a memorial of Baptism may
take place from time to time in all churches and chapels, even in Masses
anticipated on Saturday evenings.<br class="wordsection"/>
If this rite is celebrated during Mass, it takes the place of the usual
Penitential Act at the beginning of Mass.<br class="wordsection"/>
2. After the greeting, the Priest stands at his chair and faces the people.
With a vessel containing the water to be blessed before him, he invites the
people to pray in these or similar words:</p>

<p class="calibre6">Dear brothers and sisters,<br class="wordsection"/>
let us humbly beseech the Lord our God <br class="wordsection"/>
to bless this water he has created,<br class="wordsection"/>
which will be sprinkled on us <br class="wordsection"/>
as a memorial of our Baptism. </p>

<p class="calibre6">May he help us by his grace<br class="wordsection"/>
to remain faithful to the Spirit we have received.</p>

<p class="rubric">And after a brief pause for
silence, he continues with hands joined:</p>

<p class="calibre6">Option 1 | <a href="#BAS2">Option 2</a> | <a href="#BAS3">Option 3</a></p>

<p class="calibre6"><a id="BAS1"></a>Almighty ever-living God,<br class="wordsection"/>
who willed that through water,<br class="wordsection"/>
the fountain of life and the source of purification,<br class="wordsection"/>
even souls should be cleansed and receive the gift of eternal life;<br class="wordsection"/>
be pleased, we pray, to <span class="red1">+</span> bless this water,<br class="wordsection"/>
by which we seek protection on this your day, O Lord.</p>

<p class="calibre6">Renew the living spring of your grace within
us,<br class="wordsection"/>
and grant that by this water we may be defended<br class="wordsection"/>
from all ills of spirit and body,<br class="wordsection"/>
and so approach you with hearts made clean<br class="wordsection"/>
and worthily receive your salvation.<br class="wordsection"/>
Through Christ our Lord.</p>

<p class="response">Amen.</p>

<p class="rubric"><a id="Sprinkling">4.
Afterwards, taking the aspergillum, the Priest sprinkles himself and the
ministers, then the clergy and people, moving through the church, if
appropriate. Meanwhile, one of the following chants, or another appropriate
chant is sung.</a></p>

<p class="rubric"><span>5. When he returns to his chair and the singing is over, the Priest stands
facing the people and, with hands joined, says:</span></p>

<p class="calibre6"><span><a id="BAS2"></a>Almighty Lord and God,<br class="wordsection"/>
who are the source and origin of all life, <br class="wordsection"/>
whether of body or soul,<br class="wordsection"/>
we ask you to </span><span><span class="red1">+</span></span> bless this water,<br class="wordsection"/>
which we use in confidence<br class="wordsection"/>
to implore forgiveness for our sins<br class="wordsection"/>
and to obtain the protection of your grace <br class="wordsection"/>
against all illness and every snare of the enemy. </p>

<p class="calibre6"><span>Grant,
O Lord, in your mercy,<br class="wordsection"/>
that living waters may always spring up for our salvation, <br class="wordsection"/>
and so may we approach you with a pure heart<br class="wordsection"/>

Through Christ our Lord.</span></p>

<p class="calibre6"><span>Lord
our God,<br class="wordsection"/>
in your mercy be present to your people’s prayers,<br class="wordsection"/>
and for us who recall the wondrous work of our creation <br class="wordsection"/>
and the still greater work of our redemption,<br class="wordsection"/>
graciously </span><span><span class="red1">+</span></span> bless this water.</p>

<p class="calibre6"><span>For you
created water to make the fields fruitful <br class="wordsection"/>
and to refresh and cleanse our bodies.<br class="wordsection"/>
You also made water the instrument of your mercy: <br class="wordsection"/>
for through water you freed your people from slavery <br class="wordsection"/>
and quenched their thirst in the desert;<br class="wordsection"/>
through water the Prophets proclaimed the new covenant <br class="wordsection"/>
you were to enter upon with the human race;<br class="wordsection"/>
and last of all,<br class="wordsection"/>
through water, which Christ made holy in the Jordan, <br class="wordsection"/>
you have renewed our corrupted nature<br class="wordsection"/>
in the bath of regeneration.</span></p>

<p class="calibre6"><span>Therefore,
may this water be for us<br class="wordsection"/>
a memorial of the Baptism we have received,<br class="wordsection"/>
and grant that we may share<br class="wordsection"/>
in the gladness of our brothers and sisters<br class="wordsection"/>
who at Easter have received their baptism.<br class="wordsection"/>
Through Christ our Lord.</span></p>

<h4 class="calibre5"><span><a id="BoS"></a>Blessing of Salt</span></h4>

<p class="rubric"><span>3. Where the circumstances of the place or the custom of the people
suggest that the mixing of salt be preserved in the blessing of water, the
Priest may bless salt, saying:</span></p>

<p class="calibre6"><span>We
humbly ask you, almighty God:<br class="wordsection"/>
be pleased in your faithful love to <br class="wordsection"/>
+ bless this salt you have created,<br class="wordsection"/>

the prophet Elisha to cast salt into water<br class="wordsection"/>
that impure water might be purified.</span></p>

<p class="calibre6"><span>Grant,
O Lord, we pray,<br class="wordsection"/>
that wherever this mixture of salt and water is sprinkled, <br class="wordsection"/>
every attack of the Enemy may be repulsed<br class="wordsection"/>
and your Holy Spirit may be present<br class="wordsection"/>
to keep us safe at all times.</span></p>

<p class="calibre6"><span>Through
Christ our Lord.</span></p>

<p class="response"><span>Amen.</span></p>
