<h1 id="calibre_toc_35" class="calibre1">MASSES AND PRAYERS <br class="calibre4"/>
FOR VARIOUS NEEDS <br class="calibre4"/>
AND INTENTIONS</h1>

<p class="rubric">This section groups together
Masses and prayers for various intentions, which may be used in many
situations, and for various needs and occasions.</p>

<p class="rubric">The texts found in the first two
parts may be used either in a Mass with the people or in a Mass without the
people. The texts Collected in the third part may, in general, be used in
Masses celebrated without the people, unless at times a pastoral reason
suggests otherwise.</p>

<p class="rubric">In case of some grave need, a
corresponding Mass may be said on the instructions of the local Ordinary or
with his permission, on any day except on Solemnities, the Sundays of Advent,
Lent, and Easter, days within the Octave of Easter, the Commemoration of All
the Faithful Departed (All Souls’ Day), Ash Wednesday, and on the weekdays of
Holy Week.</p>

<p class="rubric">If, however, some real necessity
or pastoral advantage requires it, in the judgment of the Rector of the church
or the Priest Celebrant himself, an appropriate Mass or a Collect may be used
in a celebration with the people even if on that day there occurs an obligatory
Memorial or a weekday of Advent up to and including 16 December, a weekday of
Christmas Time from 2 January or of Easter Time after the Octave of Easter.</p>

<p class="rubric">During Easter Time, Alleluia is
added to the Entrance Antiphon and Communion Antiphon, unless this would be
not in accord with the sense.</p>

<p class="rubric">In a Mass for a weekday in
Ordinary Time, the Priest may always use all the prayers of this series, or
even only the Collect; observing what is indicated in no. 1.</p>

<p class="rubric">As for the Eucharistic Prayer
which may be used with formularies of the Masses for Various Needs, see
Appendix I to the Order of Mass.</p>

<p class="rubric">In certain Masses, the
liturgical texts given for a man may be adapted for a woman, with the necessary
change of gender; in addition, those expressed in the plural may be used for
individuals, with the necessary change to the singular.</p>

<p class="rubric">These Masses may be said with
the colour proper to the day or the liturgical time or with the colour violet
if they have a penitential character, see e.g., nos. 31, 33, 38 (cf. the
General Instruction, no. 347).</p>
