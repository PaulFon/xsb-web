<h3 class="calibre2">The hope of resurrection in Christ</h3>

<p class="rubric">78. The following Preface is
said in Masses for the Dead. </p>

<p class="calibre6">The Lord be with you.</p>

<p class="response">And with your spirit.</p>

<p class="calibre6">Lift up your hearts.</p>

<p class="response">We lift them up to the Lord.</p>

<p class="calibre6">Let us give thanks to the Lord our God.</p>

<p class="response">It is right and just.</p>

<p class="calibre6">It is truly right and just, our duty and our
salvation, always and everywhere to give you thanks, Lord, holy Father,
almighty and eternal God, through Christ our Lord. </p>

<p class="calibre6">In him the hope of blessed resurrection has
dawned, that those saddened by the certainty of dying, might be consoled by the
promise of immortality to come. </p>

<p class="calibre6">Indeed for your faithful, Lord, life is
changed not ended, and, when this earthly dwelling turns to dust, an eternal
dwelling is made ready for them in heaven. </p>

<p class="calibre6">And so, with Angels and Archangels, with
Thrones and Dominions, and with all the hosts and Powers of heaven, we sing the
hymn of your glory, as without end we acclaim: </p>

<p class="all">Holy, Holy, Holy Lord God of hosts.
Heaven and earth are full of your glory. Hosanna in the highest. Blessed is he
who comes in the name of the Lord. Hosanna in the highest.</p>
