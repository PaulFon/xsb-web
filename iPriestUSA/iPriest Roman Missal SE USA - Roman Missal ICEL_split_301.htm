<h3 class="calibre2">The action of the Saints</h3>

<p class="rubric">67. The following Preface is
said in Masses of All Saints, of Patron Saints and of Saints who are Titulars
of a church, and on Solemnities and Feasts of Saints, unless a proper Preface
is to be said. This Preface may be said also on Memorials of Saints. </p>

<p class="calibre6">The Lord be with you.</p>

<p class="response">And with your spirit.</p>

<p class="calibre6">Lift up your hearts.</p>

<p class="response">We lift them up to the Lord.</p>

<p class="calibre6">Let us give thanks to the Lord our God.</p>

<p class="response">It is right and just.</p>

<p class="calibre6">It is truly right and just, our duty and our salvation,
always and everywhere to give you thanks, Lord, holy Father, almighty and
eternal God, through Christ our Lord. </p>

<p class="calibre6">For in the marvellous confession of your
Saints, you make your Church fruitful with strength ever new and offer us sure
signs of your love. And that your saving mysteries may be fulfilled, their
great example lends us courage, their fervent prayers sustain us in all we do. </p>

<p class="calibre6">And so, Lord, with all the Angels and Saints,
we, too, give you thanks, as in exultation we acclaim: </p>

<p class="all">Holy, Holy, Holy Lord God of hosts.
Heaven and earth are full of your glory. Hosanna in the highest. Blessed is he
who comes in the name of the Lord. Hosanna in the highest.</p>
