<h3 class="calibre2">The sign and example of martyrdom</h3>

<p class="rubric">68. The following Preface is
said on the Solemnities and Feasts of Holy Martyrs. It may also be said on
their Memorials. </p>

<p class="calibre6">The Lord be with you.</p>

<p class="response">And with your spirit.</p>

<p class="calibre6">Lift up your hearts.</p>

<p class="response">We lift them up to the Lord.</p>

<p class="calibre6">Let us give thanks to the Lord our God.</p>

<p class="response">It is right and just.</p>

<p class="calibre6">It is truly right and just, our duty and our
salvation, always and everywhere to give you thanks, Lord, holy Father,
almighty and eternal God. </p>

<p class="calibre6">For the blood of your blessed Martyr <span class="red1">N.</span>,  poured out like Christ’s to glorify your name, shows
forth your marvellous works, by which in our weakness you perfect your power
and on the feeble bestow strength to bear you witness, through Christ our Lord.
</p>

<p class="calibre6">And so, with the Powers of heaven, we worship
you constantly on earth, and before your majesty without end we acclaim: </p>

<p class="all">Holy, Holy, Holy Lord God of hosts.
Heaven and earth are full of your glory. Hosanna in the highest. Blessed is he
who comes in the name of the Lord. Hosanna in the highest.</p>
