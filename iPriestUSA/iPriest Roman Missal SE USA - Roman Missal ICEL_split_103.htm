<h3 class="calibre2"><a class="calibre3" id="L611"></a>First Form: The Procession</h3>

<p class="rubric">At an appropriate hour, a gathering takes place at a smaller
church or other suitable place other than inside the church to which the
procession will go. The faithful hold branches in their hands. Wearing the red
sacred vestments as for Mass, the Priest and the Deacon, accompanied by other
ministers, approach the place where the people are gathered. Instead of the
chasuble, the Priest may wear a cope, which he leaves aside when the procession
is over, and puts on a chasuble. Meanwhile, the following antiphon or another
appropriate chant is sung. </p>

<p class="anth">Ant. | Mt 21: 9 </p>

<p class="calibre6">Hosanna to the Son of David, <br class="wordsection"/>
blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord,<br class="wordsection"/>
the King of Israel: Hosanna in the highest.</p>

<p class="rubric">After this, the Priest and people sign themselves, while the
Priest says: In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit.
Then he greets the people in the usual way. A brief address is given, in which
the faithful are invited to participate actively and consciously in the
celebration of this day, in these or similar words:</p>

<p class="calibre6">Dear brethren (brothers and sisters), <br class="wordsection"/>
since the beginning of Lent until now<br class="wordsection"/>
we have prepared our hearts by penance and charitable works.<br class="wordsection"/>
Today we gather together to herald with the whole Church<br class="wordsection"/>
the beginning of the celebration <br class="wordsection"/>
of our Lord’s Paschal Mystery,<br class="wordsection"/>
that is to say, of his Passion and Resurrection. </p>

<p class="calibre6">For it was to accomplish this mystery<br class="wordsection"/>
that he entered his own city of Jerusalem. <br class="wordsection"/>
Therefore, with all faith and devotion,<br class="wordsection"/>
let us commemorate<br class="wordsection"/>
the Lord’s entry into the city for our salvation, <br class="wordsection"/>
following in his footsteps,<br class="wordsection"/>
so that, being made by his grace partakers of the Cross,<br class="wordsection"/>
we may have a share also in his Resurrection and in his life.</p>

<p class="rubric">After the address, the Priest says one of the following prayers
with hands extended.</p>

<p class="calibre6">Let us pray.</p>

<p class="calibre6">Almighty ever-living God,<br class="wordsection"/>
sanctify <span class="red1">+</span> these branches with your blessing,<br class="wordsection"/>
that we, who follow Christ the King in exultation, <br class="wordsection"/>
may reach the eternal Jerusalem through him. </p>

<p class="calibre6">Who lives and re igns for ever and ever.<br class="wordsection"/>
R. Amen.</p>

<p class="rubric">Or:</p>

<p class="calibre6">Increase the faith of those who place their hope in you, <br class="wordsection"/>
O God, and graciously hear the prayers of those who call on you,<br class="wordsection"/>
that we, who today hold high these branches<br class="wordsection"/>
to hail Christ in his triumph,<br class="wordsection"/>
may bear fruit for you by good works accomplished in him. </p>

<p class="calibre6">Who lives and reigns for ever and ever.</p>

<p class="calibre6">R. Amen.</p>

<p class="rubric">He sprinkles the branches with holy water without saying
anything.</p>

<p class="rubric">Then a Deacon or, if there is no Deacon, a Priest, proclaims in
the usual way the Gospel concerning the Lord’s entrance according to one of the
four Gospels. If appropriate, incense may be used.</p>

<h4 class="calibre5">A reading from the holy Gospel according to Matthew. 21: 1-11 [JB]</h4>
<p class="rubric">Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord.</p>
<p class="calibre6">When they drew near to Jerusalem and came to Bethphage, to the Mount of Olives, Jesus sent two disciples, saying to them, ‘Go into the village opposite you, and immediately you will find an ass tied, and a colt with her; untie them and bring them to me. If anyone says anything to you, you shall say, “The Lord has need of them,” and he will send them immediately’. This took place to fulfil what was spoken by the prophet, saying,</p>
<p class="calibre6">‘Tell the daughter of Zion, <br class="wordsection"/>
Behold, your king is coming to you, <br class="wordsection"/>
humble and mounted on an ass, <br class="wordsection"/>
and on a colt, the foal of an ass’.</p>
<p class="calibre6">The disciples went and did as Jesus had directed them; they brought the ass and the colt, and put their garments on them, and he sat thereon. Most of the crowd spread their garments on the road, and others cut branches from the trees and spread them on the road. And the crowds that went before him and that followed him shouted,</p>
<p class="calibre6">‘Hosanna to the Son of David!<br class="wordsection"/>
Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord!<br class="wordsection"/> 
Hosanna in the highest!’</p>
<p class="calibre6">And when he entered Jerusalem all the city was stirred, saying, ‘Who is this?’ And the crowds said, ‘This is the prophet Jesus from Nazareth of Galilee’.</p>

<p class="rubric">Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord.</p>
<p class="calibre6">When they drew near to Jerusalem, to Bethphage and Bethany at the Mount of Olives, Jesus sent two of his disciples, and said to them, ‘Go into the village opposite you, and immediately as you enter it you will find a colt tied, on which no one has ever sat; untie it and bring it. If anyone says to you, “Why are you doing this?” say, “The Lord has need of it and will send it back here immediately”’. And they went away, and found a colt tied at the door out in the open street; and they untied it. And those who stood there said to them, ‘What are you doing, untying the colt?’ And they told them what Jesus had said; and they let them go. And they brought the colt to Jesus and threw their garments on it; and he sat upon it. And many spread their garments on the road, and others spread leafy branches which they had cut from the fields. And those who went before and those who followed cried out, ‘Hosanna! Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord! Blessed is the kingdom of our father David that is coming! Hosanna in the highest!’</p>

<p class="rubric">Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord.</p>
<p class="calibre6">A great crowd who had come to the feast heard that Jesus was coming to Jerusalem. So they took branches of palm trees and went out to meet him, crying, ‘Hosanna! Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord, the king of Israel!’ And Jesus found a young ass and sat upon it; as is written: ‘Fear not, daughter of Zion; behold, your king is coming, sitting on an ass’s colt!’ His disciples did not understand this at first; but when Jesus was glorified, then they remembered that this had been written of him and had been done to him.</p>

<h4 class="calibre5">A reading from the holy Gospel according to Luke. 19: 28-40 [JB]</h4>
<p class="rubric">Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord.</p>
<p class="calibre6">Jesus went on ahead, going up to Jerusalem. When he drew near to Bethphage and Bethany, at the mount that is called Olivet, he sent the disciples, saying, ‘Go into the village opposite, where on entering you will find a colt tied, on which no one has ever yet sat; untie it and bring it here. If anyone asks you, “Why are you untying it?” you shall say this, “The Lord has need of it—. So those who were sent went away and found it as he had told them. And as they were untying the colt, its owners said to them, ‘Why are you untying the colt?’ And they said, ‘The Lord has need of it’.</p>
<p class="calibre6">And they brought it to Jesus, and throwing their garments on the colt they set Jesus upon it. And as he rode along, they spread their garments on the road. As he was drawing near, at the descent of the Mount of Olives, the whole multitude of the disciples began to rejoice and praise God with a loud voice for all the mighty works that they had seen, saying,</p>
<p class="calibre6">‘Blessed is the King who comes <br class="wordsection"/>
in the name of the Lord! <br class="wordsection"/>
Peace in heaven and glory in the highest!’</p>
<p class="calibre6">And some of the Pharisees in the multitude said to him, ‘Teacher, rebuke your disciples’. He answered, ‘I tell you, if these were silent, the very stones would cry out.’</p>
<p class="calibre6">The Gospel of the Lord.</p>

<p class="rubric"><a id="L61G"></a>After the Gospel, a brief homily may be given. Then,
to begin the Procession, an invitation may be given by a Priest or a Deacon or
a lay minister, in these or similar words:</p>

<p class="calibre6">Dear brethren (brothers and sisters),<br class="wordsection"/>
like the crowds who acclaimed Jesus in Jerusalem, <br class="wordsection"/>
let us go forth in peace.</p>

<p class="rubric">Or:</p>

celebrated then sets off in the usual way</a>. If incense is used, the thurifer
goes first, carrying a thurible with burning incense, then an acolyte or
another minister, carrying a cross decorated with palm branches according to
local custom, between two ministers with lighted candles. Then follow the
Deacon carrying the Book of the Gospels, the Priest with the ministers, and,

<p class="rubric">As the procession enters the church, there is sung the
following responsory or another chant, which should speak of the Lord’s
entrance.</p>

<p class="calibre6">R. As the Lord entered the holy city, the children of the Hebrews proclaimed
the resurrection of life. * Waving their branches.</p>

<p class="rubric">When the Priest arrives at the altar, he venerates it and, if
appropriate, incenses it. Then he goes to the chair, where he puts aside the cope,
if he has worn one, and puts on the chasuble. Omitting the other Introductory
Rites of the Mass and, if appropriate, the Kyrie (Lord, have mercy), he says
the Collect of the Mass, and then continues the Mass in the usual way.</p>

<h3 class="calibre2"><a class="calibre3" id="L612"></a>Second Form: The Solemn Entrance</h3>

<p class="rubric">When a procession outside the church cannot take place, the
entrance of the Lord is celebrated inside the church by means of a Solemn
Entrance before the principal Mass.<br class="wordsection"/>
Holding branches in their hands, the faithful gather either outside, in front
of the church door, or inside the church itself. The Priest and ministers and a
representative group of the faithful go to a suitable place in the church
outside the sanctuary, where at least the greater part of the faithful can see
the rite.<br class="wordsection"/>
While the Priest approaches the appointed place, the antiphon Hosanna or
another appropriate chant is sung. Then the blessing of branches and the
proclamation of the Gospel of the Lord’s entrance into Jerusalem take place as
above (nos. 5-7). After the Gospel, the Priest processes solemnly with the
ministers and the representative group of the faithful through the church to
the sanctuary, while the responsory As the Lord entered (no. 10) or another
appropriate chant is sung.</p>

<p class="rubric">Arriving at the altar, the Priest venerates it. He then goes to
the chair and, omitting the Introductory Rites of the Mass and, if appropriate,
the Kyrie (Lord, have mercy), he says the Collect of the Mass, and then
continues the Mass in the usual way.</p>

<h3 class="calibre2"><a class="calibre3" id="L613"></a>Third Form: The Simple Entrance</h3>

<p class="rubric">At all other Masses of this Sunday at which the Solemn Entrance
is not held, the memorial of the Lord’s entrance into Jerusalem takes place by
means of a Simple Entrance.<br class="wordsection"/>
While the Priest proceeds to the altar, the Entrance Antiphon with its Psalm
(no. 18) or another chant on the same theme is sung. Arriving at the altar, the
Priest venerates it and goes to the chair. After the Sign of the Cross, he
greets the people and continues the Mass in the usual way.<br class="wordsection"/>
At other Masses, in which singing at the entrance cannot take place, the
Priest, as soon as he has arrived at the altar and venerated it, greets the
people, reads the Entrance Antiphon, and continues the Mass in the usual way.</p>

<p class="anth">Entrance Antiphon Cf. Jn 12: 1, 12-13; Ps 24 (23): 9-10</p>

<p class="calibre6">Six days before the Passover,<br class="wordsection"/>
when the Lord came into the city of Jerusalem,<br class="wordsection"/>
the children ran to meet him;<br class="wordsection"/>
in their hands they carried palm branches<br class="wordsection"/>
and with a loud voice cried out:</p>

<p class="calibre6"><span class="red1">*</span>Hosanna in the highest!<br class="wordsection"/>
Blessed are you, who have come in your abundant mercy!</p>

<p class="calibre6">O gates, lift high your heads;<br class="wordsection"/>
grow higher, ancient doors.<br class="wordsection"/>
Let him enter, the king of glory!<br class="wordsection"/>
Who is this king of glory?<br class="wordsection"/>
He, the Lord of hosts, he is the king of glory.</p>

<p class="calibre6"><span class="red1">*</span>Hosanna in the highest!<br class="wordsection"/>
Blessed are you, who have come in your abundant mercy!</p>
