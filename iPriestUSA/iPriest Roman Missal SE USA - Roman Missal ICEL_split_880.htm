Celebration of the Eucharist</h2>

<h5 class="calibre31">I. General Principles</h5>

<p class="girm">288. For the celebration of the Eucharist, the People of God are
normally gathered together in a church or, if there is no church or if it is
too small, then in another respectable place that is nonetheless worthy of so
great a mystery. Therefore, churches or other places should be suitable for
carrying out the sacred action and for ensuring the active participation of the
faithful. Moreover, sacred buildings and requisites for divine worship should
be truly worthy and beautiful and be signs and symbols of heavenly realities.<a href="iPriest%20Roman%20Missal%20SE%20USA%20-%20Roman%20Missal%20ICEL_split_884.htm#fn-107"> [107]</a><a id="fn-107-bl"></a></p>

<p class="girm">289. Consequently, the Church constantly seeks the noble
assistance of the arts and admits the artistic expressions of all peoples and
regions.<a href="iPriest%20Roman%20Missal%20SE%20USA%20-%20Roman%20Missal%20ICEL_split_884.htm#fn-108"> [108]</a><a id="fn-108-bl"></a> In fact, just as she
is intent on preserving the works of art and the artistic treasures handed down
from past centuries<a href="iPriest%20Roman%20Missal%20SE%20USA%20-%20Roman%20Missal%20ICEL_split_884.htm#fn-109"> [109]</a><a id="fn-109-bl"></a> and, in
so far as necessary, on adapting them to new needs, so also she strives to
promote new works of art that are in harmony with the character of each
successive age.<a href="iPriest%20Roman%20Missal%20SE%20USA%20-%20Roman%20Missal%20ICEL_split_884.htm#fn-110"> [110]</a><a id="fn-110-bl"></a></p>

<p class="girm">On account of this, in appointing artists and choosing works of
art to be admitted into a church, what should be looked for is that true
excellence in art which nourishes faith and devotion and accords authentically
with both the meaning and the purpose for which it is intended.<a href="iPriest%20Roman%20Missal%20SE%20USA%20-%20Roman%20Missal%20ICEL_split_884.htm#fn-111">
[111]</a><a id="fn-111-bl"></a></p>

<p class="girm">290. All churches should be dedicated or at least blessed.
Cathedrals and parish churches, however, are to be dedicated with a solemn
rite.</p>

<p class="girm">291. For the proper construction, restoration, and arrangement of
sacred buildings, all those involved should consult the diocesan commission for
the Sacred Liturgy and sacred art. Moreover, the Diocesan Bishop should employ
the counsel and help of this commission whenever it comes to laying down norms
on this matter, approving plans for new buildings, and making decisions on the
more important matters.<a href="iPriest%20Roman%20Missal%20SE%20USA%20-%20Roman%20Missal%20ICEL_split_884.htm#fn-112"> [112]</a><a id="fn-112-bl"></a></p>

<p class="girm">292. The ornamentation of a church should contribute toward its
noble simplicity rather than to ostentation. Moreover, in the choice of
elements attention should be paid to authenticity and there should be the
intention of fostering the instruction of the faithful and the dignity of the
entire sacred place.</p>

<p class="girm">293. The suitable arrangement of a church, and of what goes with
it, in such a way as to meet appropriately the needs of our own age requires
not only that care be taken as regards whatever pertains more immediately to
the celebration of sacred actions but also that the faithful be provided with
whatever is conducive to their appropriate comfort and is normally provided in
places where people habitually gather.</p>

<p class="girm">294. The People of God which is gathered for Mass is coherently
and hierarchically ordered, and this finds its expression in the variety of
ministries and the variety of actions according to the different parts of the
celebration. Hence the general arrangement of the sacred building must be such
that in some way it conveys the image of the assembled congregation and allows
the appropriate ordering of all the participants, as well as facilitating each
in the proper carrying out of his function.</p>

<p class="girm">The faithful and the schola cantorum (choir) shall have a place
that facilitates their active participation.<a href="iPriest%20Roman%20Missal%20SE%20USA%20-%20Roman%20Missal%20ICEL_split_884.htm#fn-113"> [113]</a><a id="fn-113-bl"></a></p>

<p class="girm">The Priest Celebrant, the Deacon, and the other ministers have
places in the sanctuary. There, also, should be prepared seats for
concelebrants, but if their number is great, seats should be arranged in another
part of the church, though near the altar.</p>

<p class="girm">All these elements, even though they must express the
hierarchical structure and the diversity of functions, should nevertheless
bring about a close and coherent unity that is clearly expressive of the unity
of the entire holy people. Indeed, the nature and beauty of the place and all
its furnishings should foster devotion and express visually the holiness of the
mysteries celebrated there.</p>

<h5 class="calibre31">II. Arrangement of the Sanctuary for the Sacred Synaxis</h5>

<p class="girm">295. The sanctuary is the place where the altar stands, the Word
of God is proclaimed, and the Priest, the Deacon, and the other ministers
exercise their functions. It should be appropriately marked off from the body
of the church either by its being somewhat elevated or by a particular
structure and ornamentation. It should, moreover, be large enough to allow the
Eucharist to be easily celebrated and seen.<a href="iPriest%20Roman%20Missal%20SE%20USA%20-%20Roman%20Missal%20ICEL_split_884.htm#fn-114"> [114]</a><a id="fn-114-bl"></a></p>

<h4 class="calibre5">The Altar and Its Ornamentation</h4>

<p class="girm">296. The altar, on which is effected the Sacrifice of the Cross
made present under sacramental signs, is also the table of the Lord to which
the People of God is convoked to participate in the Mass, and it is also the
center of the thanksgiving that is accomplished through the Eucharist.</p>

<p class="girm">297. The celebration of the Eucharist in a sacred place is to
take place on an altar; however, outside a sacred place, it may take place on a
suitable table, always with the use of a cloth, a corporal, a cross, and
candles.</p>

<p class="girm">298. It is desirable that in every church there be a fixed altar,
since this more clearly and permanently signifies Christ Jesus, the Living
Stone (1 Pt 2:4; cf. Eph 2:20). In other places set aside for sacred
celebrations, the altar may be movable.</p>

<p class="girm">An altar is said to be fixed if it is so constructed as to be
attached to the floor and not removable; it is said to be movable if it can be
displaced.</p>

<p class="girm">299. The altar should be built separate from the wall, in such a
way that it is possible to walk around it easily and that Mass can be
celebrated at it facing the people, which is desirable wherever possible.
Moreover, the altar should occupy a place where it is truly the center toward
which the attention of the whole congregation of the faithful naturally turns.<a href="iPriest%20Roman%20Missal%20SE%20USA%20-%20Roman%20Missal%20ICEL_split_884.htm#fn-115"> [115]</a><a id="fn-115-bl"></a> The altar should usually be
fixed and dedicated.</p>

<p class="girm">300. An altar, whether fixed or movable, should be dedicated
according to the rite prescribed in the Roman Pontifical; but it is permissible
for a movable altar simply to be blessed.</p>

<p class="girm">301. In keeping with the Church’s traditional practice and with
what the altar signifies, the table of a fixed altar should be of stone and
indeed of natural stone. In the Dioceses of the United States of America, wood
which is dignified, solid, and well-crafted may be used, provided that the
altar is structurally immobile. As to the supports or base for supporting the
table, these may be made of any material, provided it is dignified and solid.</p>

<p class="girm">A movable altar may be constructed of any noble and solid
material suited to liturgical use, according to the traditions and usages of
the different regions.</p>

<p class="girm">302. The practice of the deposition of relics of Saints, even
those not Martyrs, under the altar to be dedicated is fittingly retained.
However, care should be taken to ensure the authenticity of such relics.</p>

<p class="girm">303. In building new churches, it is preferable for a single
altar to be erected, one that in the gathering of the faithful will signify the
one Christ and the one Eucharist of the Church.</p>

<p class="girm">In already existing churches, however, when the old altar is so
positioned that it makes the people’s participation difficult but cannot be
moved without damage to artistic value, another fixed altar, skillfully made
and properly dedicated, should be erected and the sacred rites celebrated on it
alone. In order that the attention of the faithful not be distracted from the
new altar, the old altar should not be decorated in any special way.</p>

<p class="girm">304. Out of reverence for the celebration of the memorial of the
Lord and for the banquet in which the Body and Blood of the Lord are offered,
there should be, on an altar where this is celebrated, at least one cloth,
white in colour, whose shape, size, and decoration are in keeping with the
altar’s structure. When, in the Dioceses of the United States of America, other
cloths are used in addition to the altar cloth, then those cloths may be of
other colours possessing Christian honourific or festive significance according
to longstanding local usage, provided that the uppermost cloth covering the
mensa (i.e., the altar cloth itself) is always white in colour.</p>

<p class="girm">305. Moderation should be observed in the decoration of the
altar.</p>

<p class="girm">During Advent the floral decoration of the altar should be marked
by a moderation suited to the character of this time of year, without
expressing in anticipation the full joy of the Nativity of the Lord. During
Lent it is forbidden for the altar to be decorated with flowers. Exceptions,
however, are Laetare Sunday (Fourth Sunday of Lent), Solemnities, and Feasts.</p>

<p class="girm">Floral decoration should always show moderation and be arranged
around the altar rather than on the altar table.</p>

<p class="girm">306. For only what is required for the celebration of the Mass
may be placed on the altar table: namely, from the beginning of the celebration
until the proclamation of the Gospel, the Book of the Gospels; then from the
Presentation of the Gifts until the purification of the vessels, the chalice
with the paten, a ciborium, if necessary, and, finally, the corporal, the
purificator, the pall, and the Missal.</p>

<p class="girm">In addition, arranged discreetly, there should be whatever may be
needed to amplify the Priest’s voice.</p>

<p class="girm">307. The candlesticks required for the different liturgical
services for reasons of reverence or the festive character of the celebration
(cf. no. 117) should be appropriately placed either on the altar or around it,
according to the design of the altar and the sanctuary, so that the whole may
be harmonious and the faithful may not be impeded from a clear view of what
takes place at the altar or what is placed upon it.</p>

<p class="girm">308. Likewise, either on the altar or near it, there is to be a
cross, with the figure of Christ crucified upon it, a cross clearly visible to
the assembled people. It is desirable that such a cross should remain near the
altar even outside of liturgical celebrations, so as to call to mind for the
faithful the saving Passion of the Lord.</p>

<h4 class="calibre5">The Ambo</h4>

<p class="girm">309. The dignity of the Word of God requires that in the church
there be a suitable place from which it may be proclaimed and toward which the
attention of the faithful naturally turns during the Liturgy of the Word.<a href="iPriest%20Roman%20Missal%20SE%20USA%20-%20Roman%20Missal%20ICEL_split_884.htm#fn-116"> [116]</a><a id="fn-116-bl"></a></p>

<p class="girm">It is appropriate that generally this place be a stationary ambo
and not simply a movable lectern. The ambo must be located in keeping with the
design of each church in such a way that the ordained ministers and readers may
be clearly seen and heard by the faithful.</p>

<p class="girm">From the ambo only the readings, the Responsorial Psalm, and the
Easter Proclamation (Exsultet) are to be proclaimed; likewise it may be used
for giving the Homily and for announcing the intentions of the Universal
Prayer. The dignity of the ambo requires that only a minister of the word
should stand at it.</p>

<p class="girm">It is appropriate that before being put into liturgical use a new
ambo be blessed according to the rite described in the Roman Ritual.<a href="iPriest%20Roman%20Missal%20SE%20USA%20-%20Roman%20Missal%20ICEL_split_884.htm#fn-117"> [117]</a><a id="fn-117-bl"></a></p>

<h4 class="calibre5">The Chair for the Priest Celebrant and Other Seats</h4>

<p class="girm">310. The chair of the Priest Celebrant must signify his function
of presiding over the gathering and of directing the prayer. Thus the more
suitable place for the chair is facing the people at the head of the sanctuary,
unless the design of the building or other features prevent this: as, for
example, if on account of too great a distance, communication between the
Priest and the congregation would be difficult, or if the tabernacle were to be
positioned in the center behind the altar. In any case, any appearance of a
throne is to be avoided.<a href="iPriest%20Roman%20Missal%20SE%20USA%20-%20Roman%20Missal%20ICEL_split_884.htm#fn-118"> [118]</a><a id="fn-118-bl"></a> It
is appropriate that before being put into liturgical use, the chair be blessed
according to the rite described in the Roman Ritual.<a href="iPriest%20Roman%20Missal%20SE%20USA%20-%20Roman%20Missal%20ICEL_split_884.htm#fn-119"> [119]</a><a id="fn-119-bl"></a></p>

<p class="girm">Likewise, seats should be arranged in the sanctuary for
concelebrating Priests as well as for Priests who are present at the
celebration in choir dress but without concelebrating.</p>

<p class="girm">The seat for the Deacon should be placed near that of the
celebrant. For the other ministers seats should be arranged so that they are
clearly distinguishable from seats for the clergy and so that the ministers are
easily able to carry out the function entrusted to them.<a href="iPriest%20Roman%20Missal%20SE%20USA%20-%20Roman%20Missal%20ICEL_split_884.htm#fn-120">
[120]</a><a id="fn-120-bl"></a></p>

<h5 class="calibre31">III. The Arrangement of the Church</h5>

<h4 class="calibre5">The Places for the Faithful</h4>

<p class="girm">311. Places for the faithful should be arranged with appropriate
care so that they are able to participate in the sacred celebrations, duly
following them with their eyes and their attention. It is desirable that
benches or seating usually should be provided for their use. However, the
custom of reserving seats for private persons is to be reprobated.<a href="iPriest%20Roman%20Missal%20SE%20USA%20-%20Roman%20Missal%20ICEL_split_884.htm#fn-121"> [121]</a><a id="fn-121-bl"></a> Moreover, benches or seating
should be so arranged, especially in newly built churches, that the faithful
can easily take up the bodily postures required for the different parts of the
celebration and can have easy access for the reception of Holy Communion.</p>

<p class="girm">Care should be taken to ensure that the faithful be able not only
to see the Priest, the Deacon, and the readers but also, with the aid of modern
technical means, to hear them without difficulty.</p>

<h4 class="calibre5">The Place for the Schola Cantorum and the Musical Instruments</h4>

<p class="girm">312. The schola cantorum (choir) should be so positioned with
respect to the arrangement of each church that its nature may be clearly
evident, namely as part of the assembled community of the faithful undertaking
a specific function. The positioning should also help the choir to exercise
this function more easily and allow each choir member full sacramental
participation in the Mass in a convenient manner.<a href="iPriest%20Roman%20Missal%20SE%20USA%20-%20Roman%20Missal%20ICEL_split_884.htm#fn-122"> [122]</a><a id="fn-122-bl"></a></p>

<p class="girm">313. The organ and other lawfully approved musical instruments
should be placed in a suitable place so that they can sustain the singing of
both the choir and the people and be heard with ease by everybody if they are
played alone. It is appropriate that before being put into liturgical use, the
organ be blessed according to the rite described in the Roman Ritual.<a href="iPriest%20Roman%20Missal%20SE%20USA%20-%20Roman%20Missal%20ICEL_split_884.htm#fn-123"> [123]</a><a id="fn-123-bl"></a></p>

<p class="girm">In Advent the use of the organ and other musical instruments
should be marked by a moderation suited to the character of this time of year,
without expressing in anticipation the full joy of the Nativity of the Lord.</p>

<p class="girm">In Lent the playing of the organ and musical instruments is
allowed only in order to support the singing. Exceptions, however, are Laetare
Sunday (Fourth Sunday of Lent), Solemnities, and Feasts.</p>

<h4 class="calibre5">The Place for the Reservation of the Most Holy Eucharist</h4>

<p class="girm">314. In accordance with the structure of each church and
legitimate local customs, the Most Blessed Sacrament should be reserved in a
tabernacle in a part of the church that is truly noble, prominent, conspicuous,
worthily decorated, and suitable for prayer.<a href="iPriest%20Roman%20Missal%20SE%20USA%20-%20Roman%20Missal%20ICEL_split_884.htm#fn-124"> [124]</a><a id="fn-124-bl"></a></p>

<p class="girm">The tabernacle should usually be the only one, be irremovable, be
made of solid and inviolable material that is not transparent, and be locked in
such a way that the danger of profanation is prevented to the greatest extent
possible.<a href="iPriest%20Roman%20Missal%20SE%20USA%20-%20Roman%20Missal%20ICEL_split_884.htm#fn-125"> [125]</a><a id="fn-125-bl"></a> Moreover, it is
appropriate that before it is put into liturgical use, the tabernacle be
blessed according to the rite described in the Roman Ritual.<a href="iPriest%20Roman%20Missal%20SE%20USA%20-%20Roman%20Missal%20ICEL_split_884.htm#fn-126">
[126]</a><a id="fn-126-bl"></a></p>

<p class="girm">315. It is more appropriate as a sign that on an altar on which
Mass is celebrated there not be a tabernacle in which the Most Holy Eucharist
is reserved.<a href="iPriest%20Roman%20Missal%20SE%20USA%20-%20Roman%20Missal%20ICEL_split_884.htm#fn-127"> [127]</a><a id="fn-127-bl"></a></p>

<p class="girm">Consequently, it is preferable that the tabernacle be located,
according to the judgment of the Diocesan Bishop:</p>

<p class="girm">a) either in the sanctuary, apart from the altar of celebration,
in a appropriate form and place, not excluding its being positioned on an old
altar no longer used for celebration (cf. no. 303);</p>

<p class="girm">b) or even in some chapel suitable for the private adoration and
prayer of the faithful<a href="iPriest%20Roman%20Missal%20SE%20USA%20-%20Roman%20Missal%20ICEL_split_884.htm#fn-128"> [128]</a><a id="fn-128-bl"></a> and
organically connected to the church and readily noticeable by the Christian
faithful.</p>

<p class="girm">316. In accordance with traditional custom, near the tabernacle a
special lamp, fueled by oil or wax, should shine permanently to indicate the
presence of Christ and honour it.<a href="iPriest%20Roman%20Missal%20SE%20USA%20-%20Roman%20Missal%20ICEL_split_884.htm#fn-129"> [129]</a><a id="fn-129-bl"></a></p>

<p class="girm">317. In no way should any of the other things be forgotten which
are prescribed by law concerning the reservation of the Most Holy Eucharist.<a href="iPriest%20Roman%20Missal%20SE%20USA%20-%20Roman%20Missal%20ICEL_split_884.htm#fn-130"> [130]</a><a id="fn-130-bl"></a></p>

<h4 class="calibre5">Sacred Images</h4>

<p class="girm">318. In the earthly Liturgy, the Church participates, by a
foretaste, in that heavenly Liturgy which is celebrated in the holy city of
Jerusalem, toward which she journeys as a pilgrim, and where Christ is seated
at the right hand of God; and by venerating the memory of the Saints, she hopes
one day to have some share and fellowship with them.<a href="iPriest%20Roman%20Missal%20SE%20USA%20-%20Roman%20Missal%20ICEL_split_884.htm#fn-131"> [131]</a><a id="fn-131-bl"></a></p>

<p class="girm">Thus, in sacred buildings images of the Lord, of the Blessed
Virgin Mary, and of the Saints, in accordance with most ancient tradition of
the Church, should be displayed for veneration by the faithful<a href="iPriest%20Roman%20Missal%20SE%20USA%20-%20Roman%20Missal%20ICEL_split_884.htm#fn-132">
[132]</a><a id="fn-132-bl"></a> and should be so arranged so as to lead the
faithful toward the mysteries of faith celebrated there. Care should,
therefore, be taken that their number not be increased indiscriminately, and moreover
that they be arranged in proper order so as not to draw the attention of the
faithful to themselves and away from the celebration itself.<a href="iPriest%20Roman%20Missal%20SE%20USA%20-%20Roman%20Missal%20ICEL_split_884.htm#fn-133">
[133]</a><a id="fn-133-bl"></a> There should usually be only one image of any
given Saint. Generally speaking, in the ornamentation and arrangement of a
church, as far as images are concerned, provision should be made for the
devotion of the entire community as well as for the beauty and dignity of the
images.</p>
