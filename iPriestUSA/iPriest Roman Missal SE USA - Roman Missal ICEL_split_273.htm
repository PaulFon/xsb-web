<h3 class="calibre2">The power of the Cross</h3>

<p class="rubric">43. The following Preface is said
during the Fifth Week of Lent and in Masses of the mysteries of the Cross and
Passion of the Lord. </p>

<p class="calibre6">The Lord be with you.</p>

<p class="response">And with your spirit.</p>

<p class="calibre6">Lift up your hearts.</p>

<p class="response">We lift them up to the Lord.</p>

<p class="calibre6">Let us give thanks to the Lord our God.</p>

<p class="response">It is right and just.</p>

<p class="calibre6">It is truly right and just, our duty and our
salvation, always and everywhere to give you thanks, Lord, holy Father,
almighty and eternal God. </p>

<p class="calibre6">For through the saving Passion of your Son
the whole world has received a heart to confess the infinite power of your
majesty, since by the wondrous power of the Cross your judgment on the world is
now revealed and the authority of Christ crucified. </p>

<p class="calibre6">And so, Lord, with all the Angels and Saints,
we, too, give you thanks, as in exultation we acclaim: </p>

<p class="all">Holy, Holy, Holy Lord God of hosts.
Heaven and earth are full of your glory. Hosanna in the highest. Blessed is he
who comes in the name of the Lord. Hosanna in the highest.</p>
