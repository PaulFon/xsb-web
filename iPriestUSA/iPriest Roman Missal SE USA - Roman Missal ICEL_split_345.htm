<p class="calibre6">The Lord be with you.</p>

<p class="response">And with your spirit.</p>

<p class="calibre6">Lift up your hearts.</p>

<p class="response">We lift them up to the Lord.</p>

<p class="calibre6">Let us give thanks to the Lord our God.</p>

<p class="response">It is right and just.</p>

<p class="calibre6">We thank you, God our Father.<br class="wordsection"/>
You made us to live for you and for each other.<br class="wordsection"/>
We can see and speak to one another, <br class="wordsection"/>
and become friends,<br class="wordsection"/>
and share our joys and sorrows.</p>

<p class="calibre6">And so, Father, we gladly thank you<br class="wordsection"/>
with everyone who believes in you;<br class="wordsection"/>
with the saints and the angels,<br class="wordsection"/>
we rejoice and praise you, saying:</p>

<p class="all">Holy, Holy, Holy Lord God of hosts.<br class="wordsection"/>
Heaven and earth are full of your glory.<br class="wordsection"/>
Hosanna in the highest.<br class="wordsection"/>
Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord.<br class="wordsection"/>
Hosanna in the highest.</p>

<p class="calibre6"><img border="0" id="_x0000_i1078" src="pc.gif" class="calibre12"/>Yes, Lord,
you are holy;<br class="wordsection"/>
you are kind to us and to all.<br class="wordsection"/>
For this we thank you.<br class="wordsection"/>
We thank you above all for your Son, Jesus Christ.</p>

<p class="calibre6">You sent him into this world<br class="wordsection"/>
because people had turned away from you<br class="wordsection"/>
and no longer loved each other.<br class="wordsection"/>
He opened our eyes and our hearts<br class="wordsection"/>
to understand that we are brothers and sisters<br class="wordsection"/>
and that you are Father of us all.</p>

<p class="calibre6">He now brings us together to one table<br class="wordsection"/>
and asks us to do what he did.</p>

<p class="rubric"><img border="0" id="_x0000_i1077" src="cc.gif" class="calibre12"/>He
joins his hands, and holding them extended over the offerings, says: </p>

<p class="calibre6">Father, we ask you to bless these gifts of bread and wine<br class="wordsection"/>
by the power of the Holy Spirit<br class="wordsection"/>
and make them holy.<br class="wordsection"/>
Change them for us into the Body and <span class="red1">+</span> Blood<br class="wordsection"/>
of Jesus Christ, your Son.</p>

<p class="calibre6">On the night before he died for us,<br class="wordsection"/>
he had supper for the last time with his disciples. <br class="wordsection"/>
He took bread,<br class="wordsection"/>
and gave you thanks.<br class="wordsection"/>
He broke the bread<br class="wordsection"/>
and gave it to his friends, saying:</p>

<p class="calibre6">TAKE THIS, ALL OF YOU, AND EAT OF IT, <br class="wordsection"/>
FOR THIS IS MY BODY, WHICH WILL BE GIVEN UP FOR YOU.</p>

<p class="calibre6">In the same way, he took a chalice of wine.<br class="wordsection"/>
He gave you thanks <br class="wordsection"/>
and handed the chalice to his disciples, saying:</p>

<p class="calibre6">TAKE THIS, ALL OF YOU, AND DRINK FROM IT, <br class="wordsection"/>
FOR THIS IS THE CHALICE OF MY BLOOD, <br class="wordsection"/>
THE BLOOD OF THE NEW AND ETERNAL COVENANT, <br class="wordsection"/>
WHICH WILL BE POURED OUT FOR YOU <br class="wordsection"/>
AND FOR MANY FOR THE FORGIVENESS OF SINS. </p>

<p class="response">Jesus has given his life for
us.</p>

<p class="calibre6">Then he said to them:<br class="wordsection"/>
DO THIS IN MEMORY OF ME.</p>

<p class="calibre6">The mystery of faith:</p>

<p class="response">We proclaim your Death, O
Lord, <br class="wordsection"/>
and profess your Resurrection until you come again. </p>

<p class="rubric">Or:</p>

<p class="response">When we eat this Bread and
drink this Cup, <br class="wordsection"/>
we proclaim your Death, O Lord, until you come again. </p>

<p class="rubric">or: </p>

<p class="response">Save us, Saviour of the world,
<br class="wordsection"/>
for by your Cross and Resurrection you have set us free. </p>

<p class="rubric"><img border="0" src="cc.gif" class="calibre12"/>The
Priest, with hands extended, says:</p>

<p class="calibre6">God our Father,<br class="wordsection"/>
we remember with joy<br class="wordsection"/>
all that Jesus did to save us.<br class="wordsection"/>
In this holy sacrifice,<br class="wordsection"/>
which he gave as a gift to his Church,<br class="wordsection"/>
we remember his death and resurrection.</p>

<p class="calibre6"><img border="0" src="c1.gif" class="calibre12"/>Father in
heaven,<br class="wordsection"/>
accept us together with your beloved Son.<br class="wordsection"/>
He willingly died for us,<br class="wordsection"/>
but you raised him to life again.</p>

<p class="quietly">We thank you and say:</p>

<p class="response">Glory to God in the highest.</p>

<p class="calibre6">Jesus now lives with you in glory,<br class="wordsection"/>
but he is also here on earth, among us.</p>

<p class="quietly">We thank you and say:</p>

<p class="response">Glory to God in the highest.</p>

<p class="calibre6">One day he will come in glory <br class="wordsection"/>
and in his kingdom<br class="wordsection"/>
there will be no more suffering,<br class="wordsection"/>
no more tears, no more sadness.</p>

<p class="quietly">We thank you and say:</p>

<p class="response">Glory to God in the highest.</p>

<p class="calibre6"><img border="0" id="_x0000_i1074" src="c2.gif" class="calibre12"/>Father in
heaven, <br class="wordsection"/>
you have called us <br class="wordsection"/>
to receive the body and blood of Christ at this table<br class="wordsection"/>
and to be filled with the joy of the Holy Spirit.<br class="wordsection"/>
Through this sacred meal<br class="wordsection"/>
give us strength to please you more and more.<br class="wordsection"/>
Lord, our God, remember <span class="red1">Francis</span>, our pope,<br class="wordsection"/>
<span class="red1">N.</span>, our bishop, and all other bishops.</p>

<p class="calibre6">Help all who follow Jesus<br class="wordsection"/>
to work for peace<br class="wordsection"/>
and to bring happiness to others.<br class="wordsection"/>
Bring us all at last <br class="wordsection"/>
together with Mary, the Mother of God,<br class="wordsection"/>
and all the saints,<br class="wordsection"/>
to live with you<br class="wordsection"/>
and to be one with Christ in heaven.</p>

<p class="rubric"><img border="0" src="pcc.gif" class="calibre12"/>He
joins his hands, takes the chalice and the paten with the host and, raising
both, he says: </p>

in the unity of the Holy Spirit, <br class="wordsection"/>
