(<i class="calibre32">i</i>Priest Missal)</h2>

<p class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Please note, approval to
use the <i class="calibre8">i</i>Priest Missal within the
Sacred Liturgy has not yet been received.</span></p>

<p class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">The key to navigating this
<i class="calibre8">i</i>Priest Missal is to use the Table of
Contents to find the correct Mass to celebrate by going to the appropriate
Proper - the Proper of Time or the Proper of Saints. You may also wish to
celebrate a Ritual Mass, a Votive Mass, a Mass for Various Needs and
Intentions, or a Mass for the Dead.</span></p>

<p class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Once you know which Mass to
celebrate after consulting your local Ordo, simply navigate to that Mass using
the <a href="iPriest%20Roman%20Missal%20SE%20USA%20-%20Roman%20Missal%20ICEL_split_000.htm#ToC"><span class="calibre7">Table
of Contents</span></a><span class="calibre7">. Once
you have decided upon the proper Mass, all of the appropriate links will be
provided there to the Ordinary of the Mass and / or to the Common of the Saint
of the day. An appropriate Preface is always linked to from the Proper or
Common, and there are links to the suitable Eucharistic Prayer from that page.
Just as in the bound Missal you need to mark the appropriate page with a
ribbon, using the ‘Bookmark’ feature provided by your eBook device is
invaluable. Unlike in the bound Missal, only a single Bookmark is needed for
each Mass.</span></span></p>

<h3 class="calibre2">Using and navigating the <i class="calibre32">i</i>Priest Missal</h3>

<p class="calibre6">The exact way that the pages of the <i class="calibre8">i</i>Priest Missal will display
and the navigation options that you will have will depend on the device that
you are using this <i class="calibre8">i</i>Priest Missal on. Ideally you
would use a touch-screen device, since that makes navigation much easier. The
major sections of the <i class="calibre8">i</i>Priest Missal have been defined as chapters, so you can use
the advance to the next or previous chapter function to quickly move through
the work; in addition, at each chapter there is a table of contents for that
section.&gt;</p>

<p class="calibre6">The best way to experience the Roman eMissal is using a tablet device, such as an Android (eg Amazon Fire) or Apple iPad. On the iPad,
perhaps the best ebook reader is the free Apple Books app. As you navigate through the <i class="calibre8">i</i>Priest Missal, you will notice the slider at the bottom of the page provides options to quickly navigate to any section, or to go back to the previous section. The “Back to page XXX” feature is key to navigating through the text. If you have begun from a Saint, you may have used the ‘Introductory Rites’ or ‘Penitential Act’ link. If so, touch on the “Back to page XXX” area on the bottom left of the page to return to the Saint’s page for the Collect. After the Prayer over the Offerings, touch on the link to the Preface, and after the Preface, touch on a link to one of the Eucharistic Prayers. After the Prayer, then touch on the link to the Communion Rite. After Communion, when you want to pray the ‘Prayer after Communion’, you will need to touch the “Back to page XXX” area two or more times to return you to the appropriate page. Of course, it may be easier to navigate back to the starting page using the ‘Bookmark’ that you set earlier.</p>
