<h3 class="calibre2">Prayer over the Offerings</h3>

<p class="calibre6">Holy Father, whose Son chose<br class="wordsection"/>
to wash the disciples’ feet<br class="wordsection"/>
and so set us an example,<br class="wordsection"/>
accept, we pray, the gifts of our service,<br class="wordsection"/>
and grant that,<br class="wordsection"/>
offering ourselves as a spiritual sacrifice,<br class="wordsection"/>
we may be filled with a spirit of humility and zeal.</p>

<p class="calibre6">Through Christ our Lord.</p>

<h3 class="calibre2">Preface: Christ, source of all ministry in the Church.</h3>

<p class="calibre6">The Lord be with you.</p>

<p class="response">And with your spirit.</p>

<p class="calibre6">Lift up your hearts.</p>

<p class="response">We lift them up to the Lord.</p>

<p class="calibre6">Let us give thanks to the Lord our God.</p>

<p class="response">It is right and just.</p>

<p class="calibre6">It is truly right and just, our duty and our
salvation, <br class="wordsection"/>
always and everywhere to give you thanks,<br class="wordsection"/>
Lord, holy Father, almighty and eternal God.</p>

<p class="calibre6">For by the anointing of the Holy Spirit<br class="wordsection"/>
you constituted your Only Begotten Son<br class="wordsection"/>
High Priest of the new and eternal covenant,<br class="wordsection"/>
and by your wondrous plan were pleased to decree<br class="wordsection"/>
that his one Priesthood should continue in the Church.</p>

<p class="calibre6">For Christ not only adorns with a royal
priesthood <br class="wordsection"/>
the people he has made his own,<br class="wordsection"/>
but with a brother’s goodness <br class="wordsection"/>
he also chooses men to become sharers in his sacred ministry<br class="wordsection"/>
through the laying on of hands.</p>

<p class="calibre6">He chooses them to lead your holy people in
charity, <br class="wordsection"/>
to nourish them with your word,<br class="wordsection"/>
and to strengthen them with the Sacraments.</p>

<p class="calibre6">As they give up their lives for you<br class="wordsection"/>
and for the salvation of their brothers and sisters,<br class="wordsection"/>
they strive to be conformed to the image of Christ himself, <br class="wordsection"/>
and offer you a constant witness of faith and love.</p>

<p class="calibre6">And so, Lord, with all the Angels and Saints,<br class="wordsection"/>
we, too, give you thanks as in exultation we acclaim:</p>

<p class="all">Holy, Holy, Holy Lord God of hosts.
Heaven and earth are full of your glory. Hosanna in the highest. Blessed is he
who comes in the name of the Lord. Hosanna in the highest.</p>

<p class="rubric">Mention of the newly ordained in
the Eucharistic Prayers is made according to the following formulas:</p>

<p class="rubric">a)In Eucharistic Prayer I, the
proper form of Hanc igitur (Therefore, Lord, we pray) is said:</p>

that of your whole family,<br class="wordsection"/>
which we make to you<br class="wordsection"/>
also for these your servants,<br class="wordsection"/>
whom you have been pleased to raise<br class="wordsection"/>
to the Orders of the Diaconate and of the Priesthood; <br class="wordsection"/>
in your mercy, we pray, keep safe your gifts in them, <br class="wordsection"/>
so that what they have received by divine commission <br class="wordsection"/>
they may fulfil by divine assistance.</p>

<p class="calibre6">Through Christ our Lord. Amen.</p>

<p class="rubric">b)In Eucharistic Prayer II,
after the words we may be gathered into one by the Holy Spirit, the following
is said:</p>

<p class="calibre6">Remember, Lord, your Church,<br class="wordsection"/>
spread throughout the world,<br class="wordsection"/>
and bring her to the fullness of charity, <br class="wordsection"/>
together with <span class="red1">Francis</span> our Pope<br class="wordsection"/>
and <span class="red1">N.</span> our Bishop.</p>

<p class="calibre6">Be mindful also of these your servants, <br class="wordsection"/>

as Deacons and Priests for the Church, and all the clergy.<br class="wordsection"/>
Remember also our brothers and sisters …</p>

<p class="rubric">c)In Eucharistic Prayer III,
after the words advance the peace and salvation of all the world, the following

<p class="calibre6">Listen graciously to the prayers of this
family... </p>

<p class="rubric">d)If the proper Preface is not
used, Eucharistic Prayer IV may be said; in its intercession, after the words
to the praise of your glory, the following is said: </p>

<p class="calibre6">Therefore, Lord, remember now<br class="wordsection"/>
all for whom we offer you this sacrifice:<br class="wordsection"/>
especially your servant, <span class="red1">Francis</span> our Pope,<br class="wordsection"/>
and <span class="red1">N.</span> our Bishop,<br class="wordsection"/>
with the whole Order of Bishops,<br class="wordsection"/>
these your servants,<br class="wordsection"/>
whom today you have been pleased to choose<br class="wordsection"/>
for the diaconal and priestly service of your people,<br class="wordsection"/>
and all the clergy.</p>

<p class="calibre6">Be mindful also of those who take part in
this offering, <br class="wordsection"/>
those gathered here before you,<br class="wordsection"/>
your entire people,<br class="wordsection"/>
and all who seek you with a sincere heart.</p>

<p class="calibre6">Remember also<br class="wordsection"/>
those who have died in the peace of your Christ ...</p>

<h3 class="calibre2">Prayer after Communion</h3>

<p class="calibre6">Grant, O Lord, to your servants, <br class="wordsection"/>
whom you have replenished with heavenly food and drink, <br class="wordsection"/>
that, for the sake of your glory and the salvation of believers, <br class="wordsection"/>
they may be found faithful<br class="wordsection"/>

of the Sacraments and of charity. </p>

<p class="calibre6">Through Christ our Lord.</p>

over the newly ordained Priests and Deacons, says: </p>

her still,<br class="wordsection"/>
protect you constantly with his grace,<br class="wordsection"/>
that you may faithfully discharge your duties.</p>

<p class="response">Amen.</p>

<p class="calibre6">May he, who has entrusted Deacons with

and ministers of charity in the world.</p>
