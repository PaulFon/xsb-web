<h3 class="calibre2">From earthly life to heavenly glory</h3>

<p class="rubric">81. The following Preface is
said in Masses for the Dead. </p>

<p class="calibre6">The Lord be with you.</p>

<p class="response">And with your spirit.</p>

<p class="calibre6">Lift up your hearts.</p>

<p class="response">We lift them up to the Lord.</p>

<p class="calibre6">Let us give thanks to the Lord our God.</p>

<p class="response">It is right and just.</p>

<p class="calibre6">It is truly right and just, our duty and our
salvation, always and everywhere to give you thanks, Lord, holy Father,
almighty and eternal God. </p>

<p class="calibre6">For it is at your summons that we come to
birth, by your will that we are governed, and at your command that we return,
on account of sin, to that earth from which we came. </p>

<p class="calibre6">And when you give the sign, we who have been
redeemed by the Death of your Son, shall be raised up to the glory of his
Resurrection. </p>

<p class="calibre6">And so, with the company of Angels and
Saints, we sing the hymn of your praise, as without end we acclaim: </p>

<p class="all">Holy, Holy, Holy Lord God of hosts.
Heaven and earth are full of your glory. Hosanna in the highest. Blessed is he
who comes in the name of the Lord. Hosanna in the highest.</p>
