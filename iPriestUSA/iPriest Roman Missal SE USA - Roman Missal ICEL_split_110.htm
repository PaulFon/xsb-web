<p class="rubric">In the Sacred Triduum, the Church solemnly celebrates the
greatest mysteries of our redemption, keeping by means of special celebrations
the memorial of her Lord, crucified, buried, and risen. The Paschal Fast should
also be kept sacred. It is to be celebrated everywhere on the Friday of the
Lord’s Passion and, where appropriate, prolonged also through Holy Saturday as
a way of coming, with spirit uplifted, to the joys of the Lord’s Resurrection.<br class="wordsection"/>
For a fitting celebration of the Sacred Triduum, a sufficient number of lay
ministers is required, who must be carefully instructed as to what they are to
do. The singing of the people, the ministers, and the Priest Celebrant has a
special importance in the celebrations of these days, for when texts are sung,
they have their proper impact. Pastors should, therefore, not fail to explain
to the Christian faithful, as best they can, the meaning and order of the
celebrations and to prepare them for active and fruitful participation.<br class="wordsection"/>
The celebrations of the Sacred Triduum are to be carried out in cathedral and
parochial churches and only in those churches in which they can be performed
with dignity, that is, with a good attendance of the faithful, an appropriate
number of ministers, and the means to sing at least some of the parts.<br class="wordsection"/>
Consequently, it is desirable that small communities, associations, and special
groups of various kinds join together in these churches to carry out the sacred
celebrations in a more noble manner.</p>
