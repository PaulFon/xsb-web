<p class="calibre6">The Lord be with you.</p>

<p class="response">And with your spirit.</p>

<p class="calibre6">Lift up your hearts.</p>

<p class="response">We lift them up to the Lord.</p>

<p class="calibre6">Let us give thanks to the Lord our God.</p>

<p class="response">It is right and just.</p>

<p class="calibre6">God, our loving Father,<br class="wordsection"/>
we are glad to give you thanks and praise<br class="wordsection"/>
because you love us.</p>

<p class="quietly">With Jesus we sing your praise:</p>

<p class="all">Glory to God in the highest. [or:
Hosanna in the highest.]</p>

<p class="calibre6">Because you love us,<br class="wordsection"/>
you gave us this great and beautiful world.</p>

<p class="quietly">With Jesus we sing your praise:</p>

<p class="all">Glory to God in the highest. [or:
Hosanna in the highest.]</p>

<p class="calibre6">Because you love us,<br class="wordsection"/>
you sent Jesus your Son<br class="wordsection"/>
to bring us to you<br class="wordsection"/>
and to gather us around him<br class="wordsection"/>
as the children of one family.</p>

<p class="quietly">With Jesus we sing your praise:</p>

<p class="all">Glory to God in the highest. [or:
Hosanna in the highest.]</p>

<p class="calibre6">For such great love<br class="wordsection"/>
we thank you with the angels and saints<br class="wordsection"/>
as they praise you and sing <span class="opt">(say):</span></p>

<p class="all">Holy, Holy, Holy Lord God of hosts.<br class="wordsection"/>
Heaven and earth are full of your glory.<br class="wordsection"/>
Hosanna in the highest.<br class="wordsection"/>
Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord.<br class="wordsection"/>
Hosanna in the highest.</p>

<p class="calibre6"><img border="0" id="_x0000_i1085" src="pc.gif" class="calibre12"/>Blessed be
Jesus, whom you sent<br class="wordsection"/>
to be the friend of children and of the poor.<br class="wordsection"/>
He came to show us<br class="wordsection"/>
how we can love you, Father,<br class="wordsection"/>
by loving one another.<br class="wordsection"/>
He came to take away sin,<br class="wordsection"/>
which keeps us from being friends,<br class="wordsection"/>
and hate, which makes us all unhappy.</p>

<p class="calibre6">He promised to send the Holy Spirit,<br class="wordsection"/>
to be with us always<br class="wordsection"/>
so that we can live as your children.</p>

<p class="all">Blessed is he who comes in the name
of the Lord.<br class="wordsection"/>
Hosanna in the highest.</p>

<p class="rubric"><img border="0" id="_x0000_i1084" src="cc.gif" class="calibre12"/>He
joins his hands, and holding them extended over the offerings, says: </p>

<p class="calibre6">God our Father,<br class="wordsection"/>
we now ask you<br class="wordsection"/>
to send your Holy Spirit<br class="wordsection"/>
to change these gifts of bread and wine<br class="wordsection"/>
into the Body and <span class="red1">+</span> Blood <br class="wordsection"/>
of Jesus Christ, our Lord.</p>

<p class="calibre6">The night before he died,<br class="wordsection"/>
Jesus your Son showed us how much you love us.<br class="wordsection"/>
When he was at supper with his disciples,<br class="wordsection"/>
he took bread,<br class="wordsection"/>
and gave you thanks and praise.<br class="wordsection"/>
Then he broke the bread, gave it to his friends, and said:</p>

<p class="calibre6">TAKE THIS, ALL OF YOU, AND EAT OF IT, <br class="wordsection"/>
FOR THIS IS MY BODY, WHICH WILL BE GIVEN UP FOR YOU.</p>

<p class="response">Jesus has given his life for us.</p>

<p class="calibre6">When supper was ended, <br class="wordsection"/>
Jesus took the chalice that was filled with wine.<br class="wordsection"/>
He thanked you, gave it to his friends, and said:</p>

<p class="calibre6">TAKE THIS, ALL OF YOU, AND DRINK FROM IT, <br class="wordsection"/>
FOR THIS IS THE CHALICE OF MY BLOOD, <br class="wordsection"/>
THE BLOOD OF THE NEW AND ETERNAL COVENANT, <br class="wordsection"/>
WHICH WILL BE POURED OUT FOR YOU <br class="wordsection"/>
AND FOR MANY FOR THE FORGIVENESS OF SINS. </p>

<p class="response">Jesus has given his life for us.</p>

<p class="calibre6">Then he said to them:<br class="wordsection"/>
DO THIS IN MEMORY OF ME.</p>

<p class="calibre6">The mystery of faith:</p>

<p class="response">We proclaim your Death, O Lord, <br class="wordsection"/>
and profess your Resurrection until you come again. </p>

<p class="rubric">Or:</p>

<p class="response">When we eat this Bread and drink this Cup, <br class="wordsection"/>
we proclaim your Death, O Lord, until you come again. </p>

<p class="rubric">or: </p>

<p class="response">Save us, Saviour of the world, <br class="wordsection"/>
for by your Cross and Resurrection you have set us free. </p>

<p class="rubric"><img border="0" id="_x0000_i1083" src="cc.gif" class="calibre12"/>The
Priest, with hands extended, says:</p>

<p class="calibre6">And so, loving Father,<br class="wordsection"/>
we remember that Jesus died and rose again<br class="wordsection"/>
to save the world.<br class="wordsection"/>
He put himself into our hands<br class="wordsection"/>
to be the sacrifice we offer you.</p>

<p class="response">We praise, we bless you, we thank you.</p>

There we shall be happy for ever<br class="wordsection"/>
with the Virgin Mary, Mother of God and our mother.<br class="wordsection"/>
There all the friends <br class="wordsection"/>
of Jesus the Lord<br class="wordsection"/>
will sing a song of joy.</p>

thank you.</p>

<p class="rubric"><img border="0" id="_x0000_i1080" src="pcc.gif" class="calibre12"/>He
joins his hands, takes the chalice and the paten with the host and, raising
