<p class="rubric">By most ancient tradition, this
is the night of keeping vigil for the Lord (Ex 12: 42), in which, following the
Gospel admonition (Lk 12: 35-37), the faithful, carrying lighted lamps in their
hands, should be like those looking for the Lord when he returns, so that at
his coming he may find them awake and have them sit at his table.</p>

<p class="rubric">Of this night’s Vigil, which is
the greatest and most noble of all solemnities, there is to be only one
celebration in each church. It is arranged, moreover, in such a way that after
the Lucernarium and Easter Proclamation (which constitutes the first part of this Vigil), holy Church meditates on the wonders the Lord God has done for his
people from the beginning, trusting in his word and promise (the second part,
that is, the Liturgy of the Word) until, as day approaches, with new members
reborn in Baptism (the third part), the Church is called to the table the Lord
has prepared for his people, the memorial of his Death and Resurrection until
he comes again (the fourth part).</p>

<p class="rubric">The entire celebration of the
Easter Vigil must take place during the night, so that it begins after
nightfall and ends before daybreak on the Sunday.</p>

<p class="rubric">The Mass of the Vigil, even if
it is celebrated before midnight, is a paschal Mass of the Sunday of the
Resurrection.</p>

<p class="rubric">Anyone who participates in the
Mass of the night may receive Communion again at Mass during the day. A Priest
who celebrates or concelebrates the Mass of the night may again celebrate or
concelebrate Mass during the day.</p>

<p class="rubric">The Easter Vigil takes the place
of the Office of Readings.</p>

<p class="rubric">The Priest is usually assisted
by a Deacon. If, however, there is no Deacon, the duties of his Order, except
those indicated below, are assumed by the Priest Celebrant or by a
concelebrant.</p>

<p class="rubric">The Priest and Deacon vest as at
Mass, in white vestments.</p>

<p class="rubric">Candles should be prepared for
all who participate in the Vigil. The lights of the church are extinguished.</p>
