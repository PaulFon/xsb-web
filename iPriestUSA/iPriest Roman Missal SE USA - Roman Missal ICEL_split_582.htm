on the Solemnity of the Immaculate Conception <br class="wordsection"/>

<p class="calibre6">The Lord be with you.</p>

<p class="response">And with your spirit.</p>

<p class="calibre6">Lift up your hearts.</p>

<p class="response">We lift them up to the Lord.</p>

<p class="calibre6">Let us give thanks to the Lord our God.</p>

<p class="response">It is right and just.</p>

<p class="calibre6">It is truly right and just, our duty and our
salvation, always and everywhere to give you thanks, Lord, holy Father,
almighty and eternal God.</p>

<p class="calibre6">For you preserved the Most Blessed Virgin
Mary from all stain of original sin, so that in her, endowed with the rich
fullness of your grace, you might prepare a worthy Mother for your Son and
signify the beginning of the Church, his beautiful Bride without spot or
wrinkle.</p>

<p class="calibre6">She, the most pure Virgin, was to bring forth
a Son, the innocent Lamb who would wipe away our offenses; you placed her above
all others to be for your people an advocate of grace and a model of holiness.</p>

<p class="calibre6">And so, in company with the choirs of Angels,
we praise you, and with joy we proclaim:</p>

<p class="all">Holy, Holy, Holy Lord God of hosts.
<br class="wordsection"/>
Heaven and earth are full of your glory. <br class="wordsection"/>
Hosanna in the highest. <br class="wordsection"/>
Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord. <br class="wordsection"/>
Hosanna in the highest.</p>
