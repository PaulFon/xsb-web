BAPTISM</h2>

<p class="rubric">The Sacraments of Christian
Initiation are usually conferred on adults during the Vigil of the Holy Night
of Easter. If, however, they are celebrated apart from the Paschal Solemnity
because of necessity, this Mass may be used with the colour white or a festive
colour on days when. Ritual Masses are permitted.</p>

<p class="rubric">This Mass may also be said for
the conferral of the Baptism of infants, under the same conditions.</p>

<p class="rubric">In this Mass, the Penitential
Act, the Kyrie and the Creed are omitted. <a href="iPriest%20Roman%20Missal%20SE%20USA%20-%20Roman%20Missal%20ICEL_split_256.htm#Gloria">The Gloria in excelsis</a> (Glory to God in the highest), however, is said.</p>
