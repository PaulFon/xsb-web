<p class="calibre6"><a href="iPriest%20Roman%20Missal%20SE%20USA%20-%20Roman%20Missal%20ICEL_split_178.htm#EPVS">Simple Form</a> | <a href="iPriest%20Roman%20Missal%20SE%20USA%20-%20Roman%20Missal%20ICEL_split_179.htm#EPD">During the Day</a></p>

<p class="rubric">This Vigil Mass may be
celebrated on the Saturday evening, either before or after First Vespers
(Evening Prayer I) of Pentecost Sunday.</p>

<p class="rubric">In churches where the Vigil Mass
is celebrated in an extended form, this may be done as follows.<br class="wordsection"/>
a) If First Vespers (Evening Prayer I) celebrated in choir or in common
immediately precede Mass, the celebration may begin either from the
introductory verse and the hymn (Veni, creátor Spíritus) or else from the
singing of the Entrance Antiphon with the procession and greeting of the
Priest; in either case the Penitential Act is omitted (cf. General Instruction
of the Liturgy of the Hours, nos. 94 and 96).<br class="wordsection"/>
Then the Psalmody prescribed for Vespers follows, up to but not including the
Short Reading.<br class="wordsection"/>
After the Psalmody, omitting the Penitential Act, and if appropriate, the Kyrie,
(Lord, have mercy), the Priest says the prayer Grant, we pray, almighty God,
that the splendour, as at the Vigil Mass.<br class="wordsection"/>
b) If Mass is begun in the usual way, after the Kyrie (Lord, have mercy), the
Priest says the prayer Grant, we pray, almighty God, that the splendour, as at
the Vigil Mass.</p>

<p class="calibre6">&gt;&gt; <a href="iPriest%20Roman%20Missal%20SE%20USA%20-%20Roman%20Missal%20ICEL_split_254.htm#TIR">Introductory Rites</a> and <a href="iPriest%20Roman%20Missal%20SE%20USA%20-%20Roman%20Missal%20ICEL_split_255.htm#PA">Penitential Act</a> <a href="iPriest%20Roman%20Missal%20SE%20USA%20-%20Roman%20Missal%20ICEL_split_869.htm#Ap68">[Sample]</a></p>

<p class="calibre6">Grant, we pray, almighty God, <br class="wordsection"/>
that the splendour of your glory may shine forth upon us<br class="wordsection"/>
and that, by the bright rays of the Holy Spirit,<br class="wordsection"/>
the light of your light may confirm the hearts<br class="wordsection"/>
of those born again by your grace. </p>

<p class="calibre6">Through our Lord Jesus Christ, your Son, who
lives and reigns with you in the unity of the Holy Spirit, one God, for ever
and ever.</p>

<p class="rubric">Then the Priest may address the
people in these or similar words: </p>

<p class="calibre6">Dear brethren (brothers and sisters),<br class="wordsection"/>
we have now begun our Pentecost Vigil,<br class="wordsection"/>
after the example of the Apostles and disciples,<br class="wordsection"/>
who with Mary, the Mother of Jesus, <br class="wordsection"/>
persevered in prayer, <br class="wordsection"/>
awaiting the Spirit promised by the Lord;<br class="wordsection"/>
like them, let us, too, listen with quiet hearts to the Word of God. </p>

<p class="calibre6">Let us meditate on how many great deeds<br class="wordsection"/>
God in times past did for his people<br class="wordsection"/>
and let us pray that the Holy Spirit,<br class="wordsection"/>
whom the Father sent as the first fruits for those who believe, <br class="wordsection"/>
may bring to perfection his work in the world.</p>

<p class="rubric">Then follow the readings
proposed as options in the Lectionary. A reader goes to the ambo and proclaims
the reading. Afterwards a psalmist or a cantor sings or says the Psalm with the
people making the response. Then all rise, the Priest says, Let us pray and,
after all have prayed for a while in silence, he says the prayer corresponding
to the reading. In place of the Responsorial Psalm a period of sacred silence
may be observed, in which case the pause after Let us pray is omitted.</p>

<h3 class="calibre2">Prayers after the Readings</h3>

<p class="rubric">After the first reading (On
Babel: Gn 11: 1-9) and the Psalm (33 [32]: 10-11, 12-13, 14-15; R. v. 12b).</p>

<p class="calibre6">Let us pray.</p>

<p class="calibre6">Grant, we pray, almighty God,<br class="wordsection"/>
that your Church may always remain that holy people, <br class="wordsection"/>
formed as one by the unity of Father, Son and Holy Spirit, <br class="wordsection"/>
which manifests to the world<br class="wordsection"/>
the Sacrament of your holiness and unity<br class="wordsection"/>
and leads it to the perfection of your charity.</p>

<p class="calibre6">Through Christ our Lord.</p>

<p class="response">Amen.</p>

<p class="rubric">After the second reading (On
God’s Descent on Mount Sinai: Ex 19: 3-8, 16- 20b) and the canticle (Dn 3: 52,
53, 54, 55, 56; R. v. 52b) or the Psalm (19 [18]: 8, 9, 10, 11; R. Jn 6: 68c).</p>

<p class="calibre6">Let us pray.</p>

<p class="calibre6">O God, who in fire and lightning<br class="wordsection"/>
gave the ancient Law to Moses on Mount Sinai <br class="wordsection"/>
and on this day manifested the new covenant in the fire of the Spirit,<br class="wordsection"/>
grant, we pray, that we may always be aflame with that same Spirit <br class="wordsection"/>
whom you wondrously poured out on your Apostles, <br class="wordsection"/>
and that the new Israel,<br class="wordsection"/>
gathered from every people,<br class="wordsection"/>
may receive with rejoicing<br class="wordsection"/>
the eternal commandment of your love.</p>

<p class="calibre6">Through Christ our Lord.</p>

<p class="response">Amen.</p>

<p class="rubric">After the third reading (On the
dry bones and God’s spirit: Ez 37: 1-14) and the Psalm (107 [106]: 2-3, 4-5, 6-7,
8-9; R. v. 1 or Alleluia):</p>

<p class="calibre6">Let us pray.</p>

<p class="calibre6">Lord, God of power,<br class="wordsection"/>
who restore what has fallen<br class="wordsection"/>
and preserve what you have restored,<br class="wordsection"/>
increase, we pray, the peoples<br class="wordsection"/>
to be renewed by the sanctification of your name, <br class="wordsection"/>
that all who are washed clean by holy Baptism <br class="wordsection"/>
may always be directed by your prompting. </p>

<p class="calibre6">Through Christ our Lord.</p>

<p class="response">Amen.</p>

<p class="rubric">Or:</p>

<p class="calibre6">O God, who have brought us to rebirth <br class="wordsection"/>
by the word of life, pour out upon us your Holy Spirit,<br class="wordsection"/>
that walking in oneness of faith,<br class="wordsection"/>
may attain in our flesh<br class="wordsection"/>
the incorruptible glory of the resurrection.</p>

<p class="calibre6">Through Christ our Lord. </p>

<p class="response">Amen.</p>

<p class="rubric">Or:</p>

<p class="calibre6">May your people exult for ever, O God, <br class="wordsection"/>
in renewed youthfulness of spirit,<br class="wordsection"/>
so that, rejoicing now in the restored glory of our adoption,<br class="wordsection"/>
we may look forward in confident hope <br class="wordsection"/>
to the rejoicing of the day of resurrection. </p>

<p class="calibre6">Through Christ our Lord.</p>

<p class="response">Amen.</p>

<p class="rubric">After the fourth reading (On the
outpouring of the Spirit: Joel 3: 1-5) and the Psalm (104 [103]: 1-2a, 24, 35c,
27-28, 29bc-30; R. v. 30 or Alleluia).</p>

<p class="calibre6">Let us pray.</p>

<p class="calibre6">Fulfill for us your gracious promise,<br class="wordsection"/>
O Lord, we pray, so that by his coming<br class="wordsection"/>
the Holy Spirit may make us witnesses before the world <br class="wordsection"/>
to the Gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ.<br class="wordsection"/>
Who lives and reigns for ever and ever. </p>

<p class="response">Amen.</p>

<p class="rubric">Then the Priest intones the hymn
The Gloria in excelsis (Glory to God in the highest).</p>

<p class="calibre6">&gt;&gt; <a href="iPriest%20Roman%20Missal%20SE%20USA%20-%20Roman%20Missal%20ICEL_split_256.htm#Gloria">The Gloria in excelsis</a> (Glory to God in the highest)</p>

<p class="rubric">When the hymn is concluded, the
Priest says the Collect in the usual way (as here below): </p>

<p class="calibre13"><a href="iPriest%20Roman%20Missal%20SE%20USA%20-%20Roman%20Missal%20ICEL_split_178.htm#EPVSC">&gt;&gt; Almighty ever-living God, who willed…</a></p>

<p class="rubric">Then the reader proclaims the
reading from the Apostle (Rom 8: 22-27), and Mass continues in the usual way.</p>

<p class="rubric">If Vespers (Evening Prayer) are
joined to Mass, after Communion with the Communion Antiphon (On the last day),
the Magnificat is sung, with its Vespers antiphon (Veni, Sancte Spíritus); then
the Prayer after Communion is said and the rest follows as usual.<br class="wordsection"/>
It is appropriate that the formula of Solemn Blessing be used. To dismiss the
people the Deacon or, if there is no Deacon, the Priest himself sings or says:</p>

<p class="calibre6">Go forth, the Mass is ended, alleluia, alleluia.</p>

<p class="rubric">Or:</p>

<p class="calibre6">Go in peace, alleluia, alleluia.</p>

<p class="response">Thanks be to God, alleluia,
alleluia.</p>
