<p class="calibre6">The Lord be with you.</p>

<p class="response">And with your spirit.</p>

<p class="calibre6">Lift up your hearts.</p>

<p class="response">We lift them up to the Lord.</p>

<p class="calibre6">Let us give thanks to the Lord our God.</p>

<p class="response">It is right and just.</p>

<p class="calibre6">It is truly right and just, our duty and our
salvation, <br class="wordsection"/>
always and everywhere to give you thanks,<br class="wordsection"/>
Lord, holy Father, almighty and eternal God.</p>

<p class="calibre6">For, bringing your Paschal Mystery to
completion, <br class="wordsection"/>
you bestowed the Holy Spirit today<br class="wordsection"/>
on those you made your adopted children<br class="wordsection"/>
by uniting them to your Only Begotten Son.</p>

<p class="calibre6">This same Spirit, as the Church came to
birth, <br class="wordsection"/>
opened to all peoples the knowledge of God<br class="wordsection"/>
and brought together the many languages of the earth <br class="wordsection"/>
in profession of the one faith.</p>

<p class="calibre6">Therefore, overcome with paschal joy,<br class="wordsection"/>
every land, every people exults in your praise<br class="wordsection"/>
and even the heavenly Powers, with the angelic hosts, <br class="wordsection"/>
sing together the unending hymn of your glory,<br class="wordsection"/>
as they acclaim:</p>

<p class="all">Holy, Holy, Holy Lord God of hosts.
Heaven and earth are full of your glory. Hosanna in the highest. Blessed is he
who comes in the name of the Lord. Hosanna in the highest.</p>
