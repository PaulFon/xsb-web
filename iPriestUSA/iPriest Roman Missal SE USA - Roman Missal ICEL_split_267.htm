<h3 class="calibre2">The exchange in the Incarnation of the Word</h3>

<p class="rubric">37. The following Preface is
said in Masses of the Nativity of the Lord and of its Octave Day, and within
the Octave, even in Masses that otherwise might have a proper Preface, with the
exception of Masses that have a proper Preface concerning the divine mysteries
or divine Persons. It is also used on weekdays of Christmas Time. </p>

<p class="calibre6">The Lord be with you.</p>

<p class="response">And with your spirit.</p>

<p class="calibre6">Lift up your hearts.</p>

<p class="response">We lift them up to the Lord.</p>

<p class="calibre6">Let us give thanks to the Lord our God.</p>

<p class="response">It is right and just.</p>

<p class="calibre6">It is truly right and just, our duty and our
salvation, always and everywhere to give you thanks. Lord, holy Father,
almighty and eternal God, through Christ our Lord. </p>

<p class="calibre6">For through him the holy exchange that
restores our life has shone forth today in splendour: when our frailty is
assumed by your Word not only does human mortality receive unending honour but
by this wondrous union we, too, are made eternal. </p>

<p class="calibre6">And so, in company with the choirs of Angels,
we praise you, and with joy we proclaim: </p>

<p class="all">Holy, Holy, Holy Lord God of hosts.
Heaven and earth are full of your glory. Hosanna in the highest. Blessed is he
who comes in the name of the Lord. Hosanna in the highest.</p>
