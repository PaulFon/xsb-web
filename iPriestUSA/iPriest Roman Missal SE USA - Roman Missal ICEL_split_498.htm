<p class="calibre6">O God, who, looking on the lowliness <br class="wordsection"/>

raised her to this grace,<br class="wordsection"/>
that your Only Begotten Son was born of her <br class="wordsection"/>
according to the flesh and that she was crowned this day <br class="wordsection"/>
with surpassing glory,<br class="wordsection"/>
grant through her prayers,<br class="wordsection"/>
that, saved by the mystery of your redemption,<br class="wordsection"/>
we may merit to be exalted by you on high.</p>

<p class="calibre6">Through our Lord Jesus Christ, your Son,<br class="wordsection"/>

<h3 class="calibre2">Prayer over the Offerings</h3>

<p class="calibre6">Receive, we pray, O Lord,<br class="wordsection"/>
the sacrifice of conciliation and praise, which we celebrate on the Assumption
of the holy Mother of God, that it may lead us to your pardon<br class="wordsection"/>
and confirm us in perpetual thanksgiving.</p>

<p class="calibre6">Through Christ our Lord.</p>

<h3 class="calibre2">Preface: The Glory of Mary assumed into heaven.</h3>

<p class="calibre6">The Lord be with you.</p>

<p class="response">And with your spirit.</p>

<p class="calibre6">Lift up your hearts.</p>

<p class="response">We lift them up to the Lord.</p>

<p class="calibre6">Let us give thanks to the Lord our God.</p>

<p class="response">It is right and just.</p>

<p class="calibre6">It is truly right and just, our duty and our
salvation, always and everywhere to give you thanks, Lord, holy Father,
almighty and eternal God, through Christ our Lord.</p>

<p class="calibre6">For today the Virgin Mother of God<br class="wordsection"/>
was assumed into heaven<br class="wordsection"/>
as the beginning and image<br class="wordsection"/>
of your Church’s coming to perfection<br class="wordsection"/>
and a sign of sure hope and comfort to your pilgrim people; <br class="wordsection"/>
rightly you would not allow her<br class="wordsection"/>
to see the corruption of the tomb<br class="wordsection"/>
since from her own body <br class="wordsection"/>
she marvelously brought forth your incarnate Son, <br class="wordsection"/>
the Author of all life.</p>

<p class="calibre6">And so, in company with the choirs of Angels,
<br class="wordsection"/>
we praise you, and with joy we proclaim:</p>

<p class="all">Holy, Holy, Holy Lord God of hosts.
Heaven and earth are full of your glory. Hosanna in the highest. Blessed is he
who comes in the name of the Lord. Hosanna in the highest.</p>
