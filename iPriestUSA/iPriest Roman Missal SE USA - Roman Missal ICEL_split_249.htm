<h3 class="calibre2">Preface: The Mystery of the Most Holy Trinity.</h3>

<p class="calibre6">The Lord be with you.</p>

<p class="response">And with your spirit.</p>

<p class="calibre6">Lift up your hearts.</p>

<p class="response">We lift them up to the Lord.</p>

<p class="calibre6">Let us give thanks to the Lord our God.</p>

<p class="response">It is right and just.</p>

<p class="calibre6">It is truly right and just, our duty and our salvation, always and everywhere to give you thanks, Lord, holy Father, almighty and eternal God.</p>

<p class="calibre6">For with your Only Begotten Son and the Holy Spirit you are one God, one Lord: not in the unity of a single person, 
but in a Trinity of one substance.<br class="wordsection"/>
For what you have revealed to us of your glory we believe equally of your Son and of the Holy Spirit, 
so that, in the confessing of the true and eternal Godhead, you might be adored in what is proper to each Person, 
their unity in substance, and their equality in majesty.</p>

<p class="calibre6">For this is praised by Angels and Archangels, Cherubim, too, and Seraphim, who never cease to cry out each day, as with one voice they acclaim:</p>

<p class="all">Holy, Holy, Holy Lord God of hosts.
Heaven and earth are full of your glory. Hosanna in the highest. Blessed is he
who comes in the name of the Lord. Hosanna in the highest.</p>

Abba, Father.</p>

<p class="calibre6">May receiving this Sacrament, O Lord our God,<br class="wordsection"/>
