IN ORDINARY TIME </h2>

<h3 class="calibre2">The Church united by the unity of the Trinity</h3>

<p class="rubric">59. The following Preface is
said on Sundays in Ordinary Time. </p>

<p class="calibre6">The Lord be with you.</p>

<p class="response">And with your spirit.</p>

<p class="calibre6">Lift up your hearts.</p>

<p class="response">We lift them up to the Lord.</p>

<p class="calibre6">Let us give thanks to the Lord our God.</p>

<p class="response">It is right and just.</p>

<p class="calibre6">It is truly right and just, our duty and our
salvation, always and everywhere to give you thanks, Lord, holy Father,
almighty and eternal God. </p>

<p class="calibre6">For when your children were scattered afar by
sin, through the Blood of your Son and the power of the Spirit, you gathered them
again to yourself, that a people, formed as one by the unity of the Trinity,
made the body of Christ and the temple of the Holy Spirit, might, to the praise
of your manifold wisdom, be manifest as the Church. </p>

<p class="calibre6">And so, in company with the choirs of Angels,
we praise you, and with joy we proclaim: </p>

<p class="all">Holy, Holy, Holy Lord God of hosts.
Heaven and earth are full of your glory. Hosanna in the highest. Blessed is he
who comes in the name of the Lord. Hosanna in the highest.</p>
