<p class="rubric">After the Procession or Solemn Entrance the Priest begins the
Mass with the Collect.</p>

<h3 class="calibre2">Collect</h3>

<p class="calibre6">Let us pray.</p>

<p class="rubric">And all pray in silence with the Priest for a while.</p>

<p class="calibre6">Almighty ever-living God,<br class="wordsection"/>
who as an example of humility for the human race to follow <br class="wordsection"/>
caused our Saviour to take flesh <br class="wordsection"/>
and submit to the Cross, <br class="wordsection"/>
graciously grant that we may heed his lesson <br class="wordsection"/>
of patient suffering <br class="wordsection"/>
and so merit a share in his Resurrection.</p>

<p class="calibre6">Who lives and reigns with you in the unity of the Holy Spirit, <br class="wordsection"/>
one God, for ever and ever.</p>

<p class="rubric">The narrative of the Lord’s Passion is read without candles and
without incense, with no greeting or signing of the book. It is read by a
Deacon or, if there is no Deacon, by a Priest. It may also be read by readers,
with the part of Christ, if possible, reserved to a Priest. Deacons, but not
others, ask for the blessing of the Priest before singing the Passion, as at
other times before the Gospel. After the narrative of the Passion, a brief
homily should take place, if appropriate. A period of silence may also be
observed.</p>

<p class="rubric">The Creed is said, and the Universal Prayer takes place.</p>

<h3 class="calibre2">Prayer over the Offerings</h3>

<p class="calibre6">Through the Passion of your Only Begotten Son, O Lord, <br class="wordsection"/>
may our reconciliation with you be near at hand,<br class="wordsection"/>
so that, though we do not merit it by our own deeds, <br class="wordsection"/>
yet by this sacrifice made once for all,<br class="wordsection"/>
we may feel already the effects of your mercy.</p>

<p class="calibre6">Through Christ our Lord.</p>

<h3 class="calibre2">Preface: The Passion of the Lord.</h3>

<p class="calibre6">The Lord be with you.</p>

<p class="response">And with your spirit.</p>

<p class="calibre6">Lift up your hearts.</p>

<p class="response">We lift them up to the Lord.</p>

<p class="calibre6">Let us give thanks to the Lord our God.</p>

<p class="response">It is right and just.</p>

<p class="calibre6">It is truly right and just, our duty and our salvation, <br class="wordsection"/>
always and everywhere to give you thanks,<br class="wordsection"/>
Lord, holy Father, almighty and eternal God, <br class="wordsection"/>
through Christ our Lord.</p>

<p class="calibre6">For though innocent he suffered willingly for sinners <br class="wordsection"/>
and accepted unjust condemnation to save the guilty. <br class="wordsection"/>
His Death has washed away our sins,<br class="wordsection"/>
and his Resurrection has purchased our justification.</p>

<p class="calibre6">And so, with all the Angels,<br class="wordsection"/>
we praise you, as in joyful celebration we, too, acclaim:</p>

<p class="all">Holy, Holy, Holy Lord God of hosts. Heaven and earth are full of your glory. Hosanna in the highest. Blessed is he who comes in the name of the
Lord. Hosanna in the highest.</p>

<p class="calibre6">Nourished with these sacred gifts,<br class="wordsection"/>
we humbly beseech you, O Lord,<br class="wordsection"/>
that, just as through the death of your Son<br class="wordsection"/>
you have brought us to hope for what we believe, <br class="wordsection"/>
