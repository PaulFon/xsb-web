<p class="rubric">1. Ordinary Time contains thirty-three
or thirty-four weeks. It begins on the Monday following the Sunday after
January 6 and continues until the beginning of Lent; it begins again on the
Monday after Pentecost Sunday and ends on the Saturday before the First Sunday
of Advent.<br class="wordsection"/>
2. The numbering of Sundays and weeks in Ordinary Time is calculated as
follows:</p>

<p class="rubric">The Sunday on which the Feast of the Baptism of the Lord occurs takes the place of the first Sunday in Ordinary Time;
the week that follows is counted as the first week in Ordinary Time. The
remaining Sundays and weeks are numbered in order until the beginning of Lent.</p>

<p class="rubric">If there are thirty-four weeks
in Ordinary Time, after Pentecost the series is resumed with the week that
follows immediately the last week celebrated before Lent; it should be noted,
however, that the Masses of Pentecost Sunday and of the Solemnity of the Most
Holy Trinity take the place of the Sunday Masses. If, however, there are
thirty-three weeks in Ordinary Time, the first week that would otherwise follow
Pentecost is omitted.</p>

<p class="rubric">3. Thus, in the Missal,
thirty-four Masses for the Sundays and weekdays in Ordinary Time are found.
They are used in this way:</p>

<p class="rubric">On Sundays the Mass
corresponding to the number of the Sunday in Ordinary Time is ordinarily used,
unless there occurs a Solemnity or a Feast of the Lord which takes the place of the Sunday.<br class="wordsection"/>
On weekdays, however, any of the thirty-four Masses may be used, provided the
pastoral needs of the faithful are taken into consideration.</p>

<p class="rubric">4. <a href="iPriest%20Roman%20Missal%20SE%20USA%20-%20Roman%20Missal%20ICEL_split_256.htm#Gloria">The Gloria in excelsis</a> (Glory to God in the highest) and the Creed are said
on Sundays; on weekdays, however, both are omitted.</p>

<p class="rubric">5. Unless a Eucharistic Prayer
is used that has a proper Preface, on Sundays one of the Prefaces for Sundays
in Ordinary Time is said; but on weekdays, a Common Preface is said.</p>

<p class="rubric">6. Two antiphons are provided
for Communion, the first from the Psalms, and the second for the most part from
the Gospel. One or the other may be selected, as circumstances suggest, but
preference should be given to an antiphon that is in harmony with the Gospel of the Mass.</p>
