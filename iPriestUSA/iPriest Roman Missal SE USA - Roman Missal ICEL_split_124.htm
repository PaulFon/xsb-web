<h3 class="calibre2">Collect</h3>

<p class="calibre6">Let us pray.</p>

<p class="rubric">And all pray in silence with the
Priest for a while.</p>

<p class="calibre6">O God, who on this day,<br class="wordsection"/>
through your Only Begotten Son,<br class="wordsection"/>
have conquered death<br class="wordsection"/>
and unlocked for us the path to eternity,<br class="wordsection"/>
grant, we pray, that we who keep<br class="wordsection"/>
the solemnity of the Lord’s Resurrection<br class="wordsection"/>
may, through the renewal brought by your Spirit,<br class="wordsection"/>
rise up in the light of life.</p>

<p class="calibre6">Through our Lord Jesus Christ, your Son,<br class="wordsection"/>
who lives and reigns with you in the unity of the Holy Spirit, <br class="wordsection"/>
one God, for ever and ever.</p>

<h4 class="calibre5">The Creed is said. | <a href="iPriest%20Roman%20Missal%20SE%20USA%20-%20Roman%20Missal%20ICEL_split_259.htm#NCreed">Nicene Creed</a> or <a href="iPriest%20Roman%20Missal%20SE%20USA%20-%20Roman%20Missal%20ICEL_split_260.htm#ACreed">Apostles’ Creed.</a></h4>

<p class="rubric">However, in Easter Sunday Masses
which are celebrated with a congregation, the rite of the renewal of baptismal
promises may take place after the Homily, according to the text used at the
Easter Vigil. In that case the Creed is omitted.</p>

<h3 class="calibre2">The Renewal of Baptismal Promises</h3>

<p class="rubric">The Priest addresses the
faithful in these or similar words:</p>

<p class="calibre6">Dear brethren (brothers and sisters), <br class="wordsection"/>
through the Paschal Mystery we have been buried with Christ in Baptism,<br class="wordsection"/>
so that we may walk with him in newness of life.<br class="wordsection"/>
And so, now that our Lenten observance is concluded,<br class="wordsection"/>
let us renew the promises of Holy Baptism,<br class="wordsection"/>
by which we once renounced Satan and his works<br class="wordsection"/>
and promised to serve God in the holy Catholic Church. </p>

<p class="calibre6">And so I ask you:<br class="wordsection"/>
Priest: Do you renounce Satan?</p>

<p class="response">All: I do.</p>

<p class="calibre6">Priest: And all his works?</p>

<p class="response">All: I do.</p>

<p class="calibre6">Priest: And all his empty show?</p>

<p class="response">All: I do.</p>

<p class="rubric">Or:</p>

<p class="calibre6">Priest: Do you renounce sin, <br class="wordsection"/>
so as to live in the freedom of the children of God? </p>

<p class="response">All: I do.</p>

<p class="calibre6">Priest: Do you renounce the lure of evil, <br class="wordsection"/>
so that sin may have no mastery over you?</p>

<p class="response">All: I do.</p>

<p class="calibre6">Priest: Do you renounce Satan, the author and
prince of sin? </p>

<p class="response">All: I do.</p>

<p class="rubric">If the situation warrants, this
second formula may be adapted by Conferences of Bishops according to local
needs. Then the Priest continues:</p>

<p class="calibre6">Priest: Do you believe in God, the Father
almighty, <br class="wordsection"/>
Creator of heaven and earth? </p>

<p class="response">All: I do.</p>

<p class="calibre6">Priest: Do you believe in Jesus Christ, his
only Son, our Lord, <br class="wordsection"/>
who was born of the Virgin Mary, <br class="wordsection"/>
suffered death and was buried, <br class="wordsection"/>
rose again from the dead <br class="wordsection"/>
and is seated at the right hand of the Father?</p>

<p class="response">All: I do.</p>

<p class="calibre6">Priest: Do you believe in the Holy Spirit, <br class="wordsection"/>
the holy Catholic Church, the communion of saints, <br class="wordsection"/>
the forgiveness of sins, the resurrection of the body, <br class="wordsection"/>
and life everlasting?</p>

<p class="response">All: I do.</p>

<p class="rubric">And the Priest concludes:</p>

<p class="calibre6">And may almighty God, <br class="wordsection"/>
the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, <br class="wordsection"/>
who has given us new birth by water and the Holy Spirit <br class="wordsection"/>
and bestowed on us forgiveness of our sins,<br class="wordsection"/>
keep us by his grace,<br class="wordsection"/>
in Christ Jesus our Lord,<br class="wordsection"/>
for eternal life.</p>

<p class="response">All: Amen.</p>

<h3 class="calibre2">Prayer over the Offerings</h3>

<p class="calibre6">Exultant with paschal gladness, O Lord, <br class="wordsection"/>

by which your Church<br class="wordsection"/>

<p class="calibre6">Through Christ our Lord.</p>

<p class="rubric">To impart the blessing at the
end of Mass, the Priest may appropriately use the formula of Solemn Blessing
for the Mass of the Easter Vigil</p>

<p class="rubric">For the dismissal of the people,
there is sung (as above no. 69) or said: </p>

<p class="calibre6">Go forth, the Mass is ended, alleluia, alleluia.</p>
