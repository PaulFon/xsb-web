LITURGY OF THE WORD</h2>

<p class="rubric">Then all sit and the First
Reading, from the Book of the Prophet Isaiah (52: 13-53: 12), is read with its
Psalm. The Second Reading, from the Letter to the Hebrews (4: 14-16; 5: 7-9),
follows, and then the chant before the Gospel.</p>

<p class="rubric">Then the narrative of the Lord’s
Passion according to John (18: 1-19: 42) is read in the same way as on the
preceding Sunday. After the reading of the Lord’s Passion, the Priest gives a
brief homily and, at its end, the faithful may be invited to spend a short time
in prayer.</p>

<h3 class="calibre2">The Solemn Intercessions</h3>

<p class="rubric">The Liturgy of the Word
concludes with the Solemn Intercessions, which take place in this way: the
Deacon, if a Deacon is present, or if he is not, a lay minister, stands at the
ambo, and sings or says the invitation in which the intention is expressed.
Then all pray in silence for a while, and afterwards the Priest, standing at
the chair or, if appropriate, at the altar, with hands extended, sings or says
the prayer. The faithful may remain either kneeling or standing throughout the
entire period of the prayers.<br class="wordsection"/>
Before the Priest’s prayer, in accord with tradition, it is permissible to use
the Deacon’s invitations “Let us kneel - Let us stand”, with all kneeling for
silent prayer.</p>

<p class="rubric">The Conferences of Bishops may
provide other invitations to introduce the prayer of the Priest. In a situation
of grave public need, the Diocesan Bishop may permit or order the addition of a
special intention.</p>

<h3 class="calibre2">1. For Holy Church</h3>

<p class="rubric">The prayer is sung in the simple
tone or, if the invitations Let us kneel - Let us stand are used, in the solemn
tone.</p>
