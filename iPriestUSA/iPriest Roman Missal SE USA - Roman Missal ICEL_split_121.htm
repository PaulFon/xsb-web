PART: <br class="calibre4"/>
THE LITURGY OF THE WORD</h2>

<p class="rubric">In this Vigil, the mother of all
Vigils, nine readings are provided, namely seven from the Old Testament and two
from the New (the Epistle and Gospel), all of which should be read whenever
this can be done, so that the character of the Vigil, which demands an extended
period of time, may be preserved.</p>

<p class="rubric">Nevertheless, where more serious
pastoral circumstances demand it, the number of readings from the Old Testament
may be reduced, always bearing in mind that the reading of the Word of God is a
fundamental part of this Easter Vigil. At least three readings should be read
from the Old Testament, both from the Law and from the Prophets, and their
respective Responsorial Psalms should be sung. Never, moreover, should the
reading of chapter 14 of Exodus with its canticle be omitted.</p>

<p class="rubric">After setting aside their
candles, all sit. Before the readings begin, the Priest instructs the people in
these or similar words:</p>

<p class="calibre6">Dear brethren (brothers and sisters),<br class="wordsection"/>
now that we have begun our solemn Vigil,<br class="wordsection"/>
let us listen with quiet hearts to the Word of God.</p>

<p class="calibre6">Let us meditate on how God in times past
saved his people<br class="wordsection"/>
and in these, the last days, has sent us his Son as our Redeemer.<br class="wordsection"/>
Let us pray that our God may complete this paschal work of salvation<br class="wordsection"/>
by the fullness of redemption.</p>

<p class="rubric">Then the readings follow. A
reader goes to the ambo and proclaims the reading. Afterwards a psalmist or a
cantor sings or says the Psalm with the people making the response. Then all
rise, the Priest says, Let us pray and, after all have prayed for a while in
silence, he says the prayer corresponding to the reading. In place of the
Responsorial Psalm a period of sacred silence may be observed, in which case
the pause after Let us pray is omitted.</p>

<h3 class="calibre2">Prayers after the Readings</h3>

<p class="rubric">1. After the first reading (On
creation: Gn 1: 1-2: 2 or 1: 1, 26-31a) and the Psalm (104 [103] or 33 [32]).</p>

<p class="calibre6">Let us pray.</p>

<p class="calibre6">Almighty ever-living God,<br class="wordsection"/>
who are wonderful in the ordering of all your works,<br class="wordsection"/>
may those you have redeemed understand <br class="wordsection"/>
that there exists nothing more marvelous than <br class="wordsection"/>
the world’s creation in the beginning <br class="wordsection"/>
except that, at the end of the ages,<br class="wordsection"/>
Christ our Passover has been sacrificed. </p>

<p class="calibre6">Who lives and reigns for ever and ever. </p>

<p class="response">Amen.</p>

<p class="rubric">Or, On the creation of man:</p>

<p class="calibre6">O God, who wonderfully created human nature <br class="wordsection"/>
and still more wonderfully redeemed it,<br class="wordsection"/>
grant us, we pray,<br class="wordsection"/>
to set our minds against the enticements of sin, <br class="wordsection"/>
that we may merit to attain eternal joys. </p>

<p class="calibre6">Through Christ our Lord.</p>

<p class="response">Amen.</p>

<p class="rubric">2. After the second reading (On

[15]).</p>

<p class="calibre6">Let us pray.</p>

<p class="calibre6">O God, supreme Father of the faithful, <br class="wordsection"/>
who increase the children of your promise <br class="wordsection"/>
by pouring out the grace of adoption<br class="wordsection"/>
throughout the whole world<br class="wordsection"/>
and who through the Paschal Mystery<br class="wordsection"/>
make your servant Abraham father of nations, <br class="wordsection"/>
as once you swore,<br class="wordsection"/>

<p class="calibre6">O God, whose ancient wonders<br class="wordsection"/>
remain undimmed in splendour even in our day, <br class="wordsection"/>
for what you once bestowed on a single people, <br class="wordsection"/>
freeing them from Pharaoh’s persecution<br class="wordsection"/>
by the power of your right hand<br class="wordsection"/>
now you bring about as the salvation of the nations <br class="wordsection"/>
through the waters of rebirth,<br class="wordsection"/>
grant, we pray, that the whole world<br class="wordsection"/>
may become children of Abraham<br class="wordsection"/>
and inherit the dignity of Israel’s birthright. </p>

<p class="calibre6">Through Christ our Lord.</p>

<p class="response">Amen.</p>

<p class="rubric">Or:</p>

<p class="calibre6">O God, who by the light of the New Testament <br class="wordsection"/>
have unlocked the meaning<br class="wordsection"/>
of wonders worked in former times,<br class="wordsection"/>
so that the Red Sea prefigures the sacred font <br class="wordsection"/>
and the nation delivered from slavery<br class="wordsection"/>
foreshadows the Christian people,<br class="wordsection"/>
grant, we pray, that all nations,<br class="wordsection"/>
obtaining the privilege of Israel by merit of faith, <br class="wordsection"/>
may be reborn by partaking of your Spirit. </p>

<p class="calibre6">Through Christ our Lord.</p>

<p class="response">Amen.</p>

<p class="rubric">4. After the fourth reading (On
the new Jerusalem: Is 54: 5-14) and the Psalm (30 [29]).</p>

<p class="calibre6">Let us pray.</p>

<p class="calibre6">Almighty ever-living God,<br class="wordsection"/>
surpass, for the honour of your name,<br class="wordsection"/>
what you pledged to the Patriarchs by reason of their faith,<br class="wordsection"/>
and through sacred adoption increase the children of your promise, so that what
the Saints of old never doubted would come to pass your Church may now see in
great part fulfilled.</p>

<p class="calibre6">Through Christ our Lord.</p>

<p class="response">Amen.</p>

<p class="rubric">Alternatively, other prayers may
be used from among those which follow the readings that have been omitted.</p>

<p class="rubric">5. After the fifth reading (On
salvation freely offered to all: Is 55: 1-11) and the canticle (Is 12).</p>

<p class="calibre6">Let us pray.</p>

<p class="calibre6">Almighty ever-living God,<br class="wordsection"/>
sole hope of the world,<br class="wordsection"/>
who by the preaching of your Prophets<br class="wordsection"/>
unveiled the mysteries of this present age, <br class="wordsection"/>
graciously increase the longing of your people, <br class="wordsection"/>
for only at the prompting of your grace<br class="wordsection"/>
do the faithful progress in any kind of virtue. </p>

<p class="calibre6">Through Christ our Lord.</p>

<p class="response">Amen.</p>

<p class="rubric">6. After the sixth reading (On
the fountain of wisdom: Bar 3: 9-15, 31-4: 4) and the Psalm (19 [18]).</p>

<p class="calibre6">Let us pray.</p>

<p class="calibre6">O God, who constantly increase your Church <br class="wordsection"/>
by your call to the nations,<br class="wordsection"/>
graciously grant to those you wash clean <br class="wordsection"/>
in the waters of Baptism the assurance of your unfailing protection. </p>

<p class="calibre6">Through Christ our Lord.</p>

<p class="response">Amen.</p>

<p class="rubric">7. After the seventh reading (On
a new heart and new spirit: Ez 36: 16-28) and the Psalm (42-43 [41-42]).</p>

<p class="calibre6">Let us pray.</p>

<p class="calibre6">O God of unchanging power and eternal light,<br class="wordsection"/>
look with favour on the wondrous mystery of the whole Church <br class="wordsection"/>
and serenely accomplish the work of human salvation,<br class="wordsection"/>
which you planned from all eternity;<br class="wordsection"/>
may the whole world know and see<br class="wordsection"/>
that what was cast down is raised up,<br class="wordsection"/>
what had become old is made new,<br class="wordsection"/>
and all things are restored to integrity through Christ, <br class="wordsection"/>
just as by him they came into being.<br class="wordsection"/>
Who lives and reigns for ever and ever.</p>

<p class="response">Amen.</p>

<p class="rubric">Or:</p>

<p class="calibre6">O God, who by the pages of both Testaments<br class="wordsection"/>
instruct and prepare us to celebrate the Paschal Mystery, <br class="wordsection"/>
grant that we may comprehend your mercy,<br class="wordsection"/>
so that the gifts we receive from you this night<br class="wordsection"/>
may confirm our hope of the gifts to come.</p>

<p class="calibre6">Through Christ our Lord.</p>

<p class="response">Amen.</p>

<p class="rubric">After the last reading from the
Old Testament with its Responsorial Psalm and its prayer, the altar candles are
lit, and the Priest intones the hymn Gloria in excelsis Deo (Glory to God in
the highest), which is taken up by all, while bells are rung, according to
local custom.</p>

<p class="calibre6"><a href="iPriest%20Roman%20Missal%20SE%20USA%20-%20Roman%20Missal%20ICEL_split_256.htm#Gloria">Gloria in excelsis Deo…</a> (Glory to God in the highest)</p>

<p class="rubric">When the hymn is concluded, the
Priest says the Collect in the usual way. </p>

<p class="calibre6">Let us pray.<br class="wordsection"/>
O God, who make this most sacred night radiant <br class="wordsection"/>
with the glory of the Lord’s Resurrection,<br class="wordsection"/>
stir up in your Church a spirit of adoption, <br class="wordsection"/>
so that, renewed in body and mind,<br class="wordsection"/>
we may render you undivided service. </p>

<p class="calibre6">Through our Lord Jesus Christ, your Son, who
lives and reigns with you in the unity of the Holy Spirit, one God, for ever
and ever.</p>

<p class="rubric">Then the reader proclaims the
reading from the Apostle.</p>

<p class="rubric">After the Epistle has been read,
all rise, then the Priest solemnly intones the Alleluia three times, raising
his voice by a step each time, with all repeating it. If necessary, the
psalmist intones the Alleluia.</p>

<p class="calibre6">Alleluia. Alleluia. Alleluia.</p>

<p class="rubric">Then the psalmist or cantor
proclaims Psalm 118 (117) with the people responding Alleluia.<br class="wordsection"/>
The Priest, in the usual way, puts incense in the thurible and blesses the
Deacon. At the Gospel lights are not carried, but only incense.</p>

<p class="rubric">After the Gospel, the Homily,
even if brief, is not to be omitted.</p>
