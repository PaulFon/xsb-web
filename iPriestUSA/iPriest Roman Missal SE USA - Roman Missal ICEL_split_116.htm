HOLY COMMUNION</h2>

<p class="rubric">A cloth is spread on the altar,
and a corporal and the Missal put in place. Meanwhile the Deacon or, if there
is no Deacon, the Priest himself, putting on a humeral veil, brings the Blessed
Sacrament back from the place of repose to the altar by a shorter route, while
all stand in silence. Two ministers with lighted candles accompany the Blessed
Sacrament and place their candlesticks around or upon the altar.</p>

<p class="rubric">When the Deacon, if a Deacon is
present, has placed the Blessed Sacrament upon the altar and uncovered the
ciborium, the Priest goes to the altar and genuflects. Then the Priest, with
hands joined, says aloud:</p>

<p class="calibre6">At the Saviour’s command<br class="wordsection"/>
and formed by divine teaching, we dare to say:</p>

<p class="rubric">The Priest, with hands extended
says, and all present continue:</p>

<p class="response">Our Father, who art in heaven,<br class="wordsection"/>
hallowed be thy name;<br class="wordsection"/>
thy kingdom come,<br class="wordsection"/>
thy will be done<br class="wordsection"/>
on earth as it is in heaven.<br class="wordsection"/>
Give us this day our daily bread,<br class="wordsection"/>
and forgive us our trespasses,<br class="wordsection"/>
as we forgive those who trespass against us; <br class="wordsection"/>
and lead us not into temptation,<br class="wordsection"/>
but deliver us from evil.</p>

<p class="rubric">With hands extended, the Priest
continues alone:</p>

<p class="calibre6">Deliver us, Lord, we pray, from every evil, <br class="wordsection"/>
graciously grant peace in our days,<br class="wordsection"/>
that, by the help of your mercy,<br class="wordsection"/>
we may be always free from sin<br class="wordsection"/>
and safe from all distress,<br class="wordsection"/>
as we await the blessed hope<br class="wordsection"/>
and the coming of our Saviour, Jesus Christ.</p>

<p class="rubric">He joins his hands. The people
conclude the prayer, acclaiming:</p>

<p class="response">For the kingdom, the power and
the glory are yours <br class="wordsection"/>
now and for ever. </p>

<p class="rubric">Then the Priest, with hands
joined, says quietly:</p>

<p class="quietly">May the receiving of your Body and Blood, <br class="wordsection"/>
Lord Jesus Christ,<br class="wordsection"/>
not bring me to judgment and condemnation, <br class="wordsection"/>
but through your loving mercy<br class="wordsection"/>
be for me protection in mind and body <br class="wordsection"/>
and a healing remedy.</p>

<p class="rubric">The Priest then genuflects,
takes a particle, and, holding it slightly raised over the ciborium, while
facing the people, says aloud:</p>

<p class="calibre6">Behold the Lamb of God,<br class="wordsection"/>
behold him who takes away the sins of the world. <br class="wordsection"/>
Blessed are those called to the supper of the Lamb.</p>

<p class="rubric">And together with the people he
adds once:</p>

<p class="response">Lord, I am not worthy<br class="wordsection"/>
that you should enter under my roof, <br class="wordsection"/>
but only say the word<br class="wordsection"/>
and my soul shall be healed.</p>

<p class="rubric">And facing the altar, he
reverently consumes the Body of Christ, saying quietly: May the Body of Christ
keep me safe for eternal life.</p>

<p class="rubric">He then proceeds to distribute
Communion to the faithful. During Communion, Psalm 22 (21) or another
appropriate chant may be sung.</p>

<p class="rubric">When the distribution of Communion has been completed, the ciborium is taken by the Deacon or another
suitable minister to a place prepared outside the church or, if circumstances
so require, it is placed in the tabernacle.</p>

<p class="rubric">Then the Priest says: Let us
pray, and, after a period of sacred silence, if circumstances so suggest, has
been observed, he says the Prayer after Communion.</p>

<p class="calibre6">Almighty ever-living God,<br class="wordsection"/>
who have restored us to life<br class="wordsection"/>
by the blessed Death and Resurrection of your Christ, <br class="wordsection"/>
preserve in us the work of your mercy,<br class="wordsection"/>
that, by partaking of this mystery,<br class="wordsection"/>
we may have a life unceasingly devoted to you. </p>

<p class="calibre6">Through Christ our Lord.</p>

<p class="response">Amen.</p>

<p class="rubric">For the Dismissal the Deacon or,
if there is no Deacon, the Priest himself, may say the invitation Bow down for
the blessing.<br class="wordsection"/>
Then the Priest, standing facing the people and extending his hands over them,
says this Prayer over the People:</p>

<p class="calibre6">May abundant blessing, O Lord, we pray, <br class="wordsection"/>
descend upon your people,<br class="wordsection"/>
who have honoured the Death of your Son <br class="wordsection"/>
in the hope of their resurrection:<br class="wordsection"/>
may pardon come,<br class="wordsection"/>
comfort be given,<br class="wordsection"/>
holy faith increase,<br class="wordsection"/>
and everlasting redemption be made secure. </p>

<p class="calibre6">Through Christ our Lord.</p>

<p class="response">Amen.</p>

<p class="rubric">And all, after genuflecting to
the Cross, depart in silence.</p>

<p class="rubric">After the celebration, the altar
is stripped, but the Cross remains on the altar with two or four candlesticks.</p>

<p class="rubric">Vespers (Evening Prayer) is not
celebrated by those who have been present at the solemn afternoon liturgical
celebration.</p>
