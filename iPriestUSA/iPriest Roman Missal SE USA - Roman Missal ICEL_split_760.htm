<p class="calibre6">Let us pray.</p>

<p class="rubric">And all pray in silence with the

join, we pray, in a bond of inseparable love <br class="wordsection"/>
these your servants <br class="wordsection"/>
who are to be united in the covenant of Marriage,<br class="wordsection"/>

the offering made on the occasion<br class="wordsection"/>

Lord, holy Father, almighty and eternal God.</p>

<p class="calibre6">For you have forged the covenant of marriage <br class="wordsection"/>

and an unbreakable bond of peace,<br class="wordsection"/>
so that chaste and fruitful love<br class="wordsection"/>

the children you adopt as your own.</p>

<p class="calibre6">By your providence and grace, O Lord,<br class="wordsection"/>
you accomplish the wonder of this twofold design:<br class="wordsection"/>
that, while the birth of children brings beauty to the world, <br class="wordsection"/>
their rebirth in Baptism gives increase to the Church, <br class="wordsection"/>
through Christ our Lord.</p>

<p class="calibre6">Through him, with the Angels and all the

Heaven and earth are full of your glory. Hosanna in the highest. Blessed is he
who comes in the name of the Lord. Hosanna in the highest.</p>

and of your whole family,<br class="wordsection"/>
who entreat your majesty on their behalf;<br class="wordsection"/>
and as you have brought them to their wedding day,<br class="wordsection"/>
so (gladden them with your gift of the children they desire and) <br class="wordsection"/>
bring them in your kindness<br class="wordsection"/>
to the length of days for which they hope.</p>

whom you have brought to their wedding day,<br class="wordsection"/>
so that by your grace<br class="wordsection"/>
they may abide in mutual love and in peace.</p>

whom you have brought happily to their wedding day, <br class="wordsection"/>

gather to yourself all your children<br class="wordsection"/>
scattered throughout the earth.</p>
