<p class="rubric">1. The rank of the celebration,
namely Solemnity, Feast, or Memorial, is indicated for each day. If no other
indication is given, the celebration is an Optional Memorial.</p>

<p class="rubric">2. For each Solemnity and Feast a
complete proper Mass is provided. This is therefore said as printed.</p>

<p class="rubric">3. As regards Memorials, the
following are to be observed:</p>

<p class="rubric">The proper texts proposed for certain
days are always to be used.</p>

<p class="rubric">Whenever there is a reference to a
particular Common, the more appropriate texts should be chosen according to the
principles explained at the beginning of the Commons. The page reference given
in each case only indicates a text that is particularly suitable.</p>

<p class="rubric">If, however, a reference is given to
several Commons, one or other of them may be used, with due regard for pastoral
concerns; it is always allowed to exchange texts among several Masses of the
same Common.</p>

<p class="rubric">For example, if a Saint is both a
Martyr and a Bishop, either the Common of Martyrs or the Common of Pastors (for
Bishops) may be used.</p>

<p class="rubric">Moreover, as well as the Commons that
refer to a particular category of Saint (e.g., of Martyrs, Virgins, Pastors,
etc.), it is always permitted to use the texts From the Common of Holy Men and
Women, which refers to Sainthood in general.</p>

<p class="rubric">The Prayers over the Offerings and
after Communion, unless they are proper, are taken either From the Common or
from the current time of the liturgical year.</p>

<p class="rubric">4. The Masses contained in this Proper of Saints are also used as Votive Masses, with the exception of Masses
of the mysteries of the life of the Lord and of the Blessed Virgin Mary (cf.
General Instruction of the Roman Missal, no. 375) and also of Masses of certain
Saints for whom a special Votive Mass is provided. When Masses of the Proper of Saints are used as Votive Masses, words in the prayers indicating the heavenly birthday or the Solemnity or Feast are not used but are replaced by the word <b class="calibre19">memorial</b>
or <b class="calibre19">commemoration</b>.</p>
