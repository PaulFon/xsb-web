<p class="calibre6"><a href="#EPV2P">&gt;&gt; The prayer itself</a></p>

<p class="calibre6"><a id="P55"></a>The Lord be with you.</p>

<p class="response">And with your spirit.</p>

<p class="calibre6">Lift up your hearts.</p>

<p class="response">We lift them up to the Lord.</p>

<p class="calibre6">Let us give thanks to the Lord our God.</p>

<p class="response">It is right and just.</p>

<p class="calibre6">It is truly right and just, our duty and our
salvation, always and everywhere to give you thanks, Lord, holy Father, creator
of the world and source of all life. </p>

<p class="calibre6">For you never forsake the works of your
wisdom, but by your providence are even now at work in our midst. With mighty
hand and outstretched arm you led your people Israel through the desert. </p>

<p class="calibre6">Now, as your Church makes her pilgrim journey
in the world, you always accompany her by the power of the Holy Spirit and lead
her along the paths of time to the eternal joy of your Kingdom, through Christ
our Lord. </p>

<p class="calibre6">And so, with the Angels and Saints, we, too,
sing the hymn of your glory, as without end we acclaim: </p>

<p class="all">Holy, Holy, Holy Lord God of hosts.
Heaven and earth are full of your glory. Hosanna in the highest. Blessed is he
who comes in the name of the Lord. Hosanna in the highest.</p>

<p class="rubric"><a id="EPV2P"></a><img border="0" id="_x0000_i1117" src="pc.gif" class="calibre12"/>The Priest, with hands extended, says: </p>

<p class="calibre6">You are indeed Holy and to be glorified, O
God, <br class="wordsection"/>
who love the human race <br class="wordsection"/>
and who always walk with us on the journey of life. <br class="wordsection"/>
Blessed indeed is your Son, <br class="wordsection"/>
present in our midst when we are gathered by his love <br class="wordsection"/>
and when, as once for the disciples, so now for us, <br class="wordsection"/>
he opens the Scriptures and breaks the bread. </p>

<p class="rubric"><img border="0" id="_x0000_i1116" src="cc.gif" class="calibre12"/>He
joins his hands and, holding them extended over the offerings, says: </p>

<p class="calibre6">Therefore, Father most merciful, <br class="wordsection"/>
we ask that you send forth your Holy Spirit <br class="wordsection"/>
to sanctify these gifts of bread and wine, </p>

<p class="rubric">He joins his hands and makes the
Sign of the Cross once over the bread and chalice together, saying: </p>

<p class="calibre6">that they may become for us <br class="wordsection"/>
the Body and <span class="red1">+</span> Blood </p>

<p class="rubric">He joins his hands. </p>

<p class="calibre6">of our Lord Jesus Christ. </p>

<p class="rubric">In the formulas that follow, the
words of the Lord should be pronounced clearly and distinctly, as the nature of these words requires. </p>

<p class="calibre6">On the day before he was to suffer, <br class="wordsection"/>
on the night of the Last Supper, </p>

<p class="rubric">He takes the bread and, holding
it slightly raised above the altar, continues: </p>

<p class="calibre6">he took bread and said the blessing, <br class="wordsection"/>
broke the bread and gave it to his disciples, saying: </p>

<p class="rubric">He bows slightly. </p>

<p class="calibre6">TAKE THIS, ALL OF YOU, AND EAT OF IT, <br class="wordsection"/>
FOR THIS IS MY BODY, WHICH WILL BE GIVEN UP FOR YOU.</p>

<p class="rubric">He shows the consecrated host to
the people, places it again on the paten, and genuflects in adoration. </p>

<p class="rubric">After this, he continues: </p>

<p class="calibre6">In a similar way, when supper was ended, </p>

<p class="rubric">He takes the chalice and,
holding it slightly raised above the altar, continues: </p>

<p class="calibre6">he took the chalice, gave you thanks and gave
the chalice to his disciples, saying: </p>

<p class="rubric">He bows slightly. </p>

<p class="calibre6">TAKE THIS, ALL OF YOU, AND DRINK FROM IT, <br class="wordsection"/>
FOR THIS IS THE CHALICE OF MY BLOOD, <br class="wordsection"/>
THE BLOOD OF THE NEW AND ETERNAL COVENANT, <br class="wordsection"/>
WHICH WILL BE POURED OUT FOR YOU <br class="wordsection"/>
AND FOR MANY FOR THE FORGIVENESS OF SINS. </p>

<p class="calibre6">DO THIS IN MEMORY OF ME. </p>

<p class="rubric">He shows the chalice to the
people, places it on the corporal, and genuflects in adoration. </p>

<p class="rubric"><img border="0" id="_x0000_i1115" src="pc.gif" class="calibre12"/>Then
he says: </p>

<p class="calibre6">The mystery of faith. </p>

<p class="rubric">And the people continue,
acclaiming: </p>

<p class="response">We proclaim your Death, O
Lord, <br class="wordsection"/>
and profess your Resurrection until you come again. </p>

<p class="rubric">or: </p>

<p class="response">When we eat this Bread and
drink this Cup, <br class="wordsection"/>
we proclaim your Death, O Lord, until you come again. </p>

<p class="rubric">or: </p>

<p class="response">Save us, Saviour of the world,
<br class="wordsection"/>
for by your Cross and Resurrection you have set us free. </p>

<p class="rubric"><img border="0" id="_x0000_i1114" src="cc.gif" class="calibre12"/>Then
the Priest, with hands extended, says: </p>

<p class="calibre6">Therefore, holy Father, as we celebrate the
memorial of Christ your Son, our Saviour, <br class="wordsection"/>
whom you led through his Passion and Death on the Cross <br class="wordsection"/>
to the glory of the Resurrection, <br class="wordsection"/>
and whom you have seated at your right hand, <br class="wordsection"/>
we proclaim the work of your love until he comes again <br class="wordsection"/>
and we offer you the Bread of life and the Chalice of blessing. </p>

<p class="calibre6">Look with favour on the oblation of your
Church, <br class="wordsection"/>
in which we show forth the paschal Sacrifice of Christ <br class="wordsection"/>
that has been handed on to us, <br class="wordsection"/>
and grant that, by the power of the Spirit of your love, <br class="wordsection"/>
we may be counted now and until the day of eternity <br class="wordsection"/>
among the members of your Son, <br class="wordsection"/>
in whose Body and Blood we have communion. </p>

<p class="calibre6"><img border="0" id="_x0000_i1113" src="c1.gif" class="calibre12"/>And so,
having called us to your table, Lord, confirm us in unity, so that, together
with <span class="red1">Francis</span> our Pope and <span class="red1">N.</span> our
Bishop,<span class="red1">*</span> with all Bishops, Priests and Deacons, and your
entire people, as we walk your ways with faith and hope, we may strive to bring
joy and trust into the world. </p>

<p class="calibre6"><img border="0" id="_x0000_i1112" src="c2.gif" class="calibre12"/>Remember our
brothers and sisters (<span class="red1">N.</span> and <span class="red1">N.</span>), <br class="wordsection"/>
who have fallen asleep in the peace of your Christ, <br class="wordsection"/>
and all the dead, whose faith you alone have known. <br class="wordsection"/>
Admit them to rejoice in the light of your face, <br class="wordsection"/>
and in the resurrection give them the fullness of life. </p>

<p class="calibre6">Grant also to us, when our earthly pilgrimage
is done, <br class="wordsection"/>
that we may come to an eternal dwelling place <br class="wordsection"/>
and live with you for ever; there, in communion with the Blessed Virgin Mary,
Mother of God, <br class="wordsection"/>
with the Apostles and Martyrs, <br class="wordsection"/>
<span class="red1">(</span>with Saint <span class="red1">N.</span> - the Saint of the day or Patron Saint<span class="red1">)</span><br class="wordsection"/>
and with all the Saints, we shall praise and exalt you </p>

<p class="rubric">He joins his hands. </p>

<p class="calibre6">through Jesus Christ, your Son. </p>

<p class="rubric"><img border="0" id="_x0000_i1111" src="pcc.gif" class="calibre12"/>8.
He takes the chalice and the paten with the host and, raising both, he says: </p>

<p class="calibre6">Through him, and with him, and in him, <br class="wordsection"/>
O God, almighty Father, <br class="wordsection"/>
in the unity of the Holy Spirit, <br class="wordsection"/>
all glory and honour is yours, <br class="wordsection"/>
for ever and ever.</p>

<p class="rubric">The people acclaim: </p>

<p class="response">Amen. | <a href="iPriest%20Roman%20Missal%20SE%20USA%20-%20Roman%20Missal%20ICEL_split_347.htm#CR">Then follows the Communion Rite.</a></p>
