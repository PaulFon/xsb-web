<h2 id="calibre_toc_104" class="calibre10"><a class="calibre3" id="L01"></a>Gathering after the fashion of the Roman ‘stations’</h2>

<p class="rubric">It is strongly recommended that the tradition of gathering the
local Church after the fashion of the Roman “stations” be kept and promoted,
especially during Lent and at least in larger towns and cities, in a way best
suited to individual places.</p>

<p class="rubric">Such gatherings of the faithful can take place, especially with
the chief Pastor of the diocese presiding, on Sundays or on other more
convenient days during the week, either at the tombs of the Saints, or in the
principal churches or shrines of a city, or even in the more frequently visited
places of pilgrimage in the diocese.</p>

<p class="rubric">If a procession precedes a Mass celebrated for such a
gathering, according to circumstances and local conditions, the faithful gather
at a smaller church or some other suitable place other than in the church to
which the procession will head.</p>

<p class="rubric">After greeting the people, the Priest says a Collect of the
mystery of the Holy Cross (option one below), for the remission of sins, or for
the Church, especially the local Church (option two below) or one of the
Prayers over the People.</p>

<h3 class="calibre2">Collect</h3>

<p class="calibre6">Let us pray.</p>

<p class="rubric">And all pray in silence with the Priest for a while.</p>

<p class="calibre6">O God, who willed that your Only Begotten Son <br class="wordsection"/>
should undergo the Cross to save the human race, <br class="wordsection"/>
grant, we pray, that we who have known his mystery on earth <br class="wordsection"/>
may merit the grace of his redemption in heaven. </p>

<p class="calibre6">Through our Lord.</p>

<p class="rubric">Or:</p>

<p class="calibre6">O God, who in each pilgrim Church throughout the world <br class="wordsection"/>
make visible the one, holy, catholic and apostolic Church, <br class="wordsection"/>
graciously grant <br class="wordsection"/>
that your faithful may be so united to their shepherd <br class="wordsection"/>
and gathered together in the Holy Spirit<br class="wordsection"/>
through the Gospel and the Eucharist,<br class="wordsection"/>
as to embody worthily the universality of your people <br class="wordsection"/>
and become a sign and instrument in the world<br class="wordsection"/>
of the presence of Christ.<br class="wordsection"/>
Who lives and reigns with you.</p>

<p class="rubric">Then the procession makes its way to the church in which Mass
will be celebrated and meanwhile the Litany of the Saints is sung. Invocations
to the Patron Saint or the Founder Saint and to the Saints of the local Church
may be inserted at the appropriate point in the Litany.</p>

<p class="rubric">When the procession reaches the church, the Priest venerates
the altar and, if appropriate, incenses it. Afterwards, omitting the
Introductory Rites and, if appropriate, the Kyrie, he says the Collect of the
Mass, and then continues the Mass in the usual way.</p>

<p class="rubric">At these gatherings, instead of Mass, some celebration of the
Word of God may also take place, especially in the form of the penitential
celebrations given in the Roman Ritual for Lent.</p>

<p class="rubric">On weekdays of Lent, at the end of Mass and before the final
blessing, the Prayer over the People indicated for each day may appropriately
be used.</p>

<p class="rubric">During Lent, it is not permitted to decorate the altar with
flowers, and the use of musical instruments is allowed only so as to support
the singing. Nevertheless, Laetare Sunday (the Fourth Sunday of Lent),
Solemnities, and Feasts are exceptions to this rule.</p>
