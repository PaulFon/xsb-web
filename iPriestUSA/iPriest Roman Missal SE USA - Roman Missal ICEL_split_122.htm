BAPTISMAL LITURGY</h2>

<p class="rubric">After the Homily the Baptismal
Liturgy begins. The Priest goes with the ministers to the baptismal font, if
this can be seen by the faithful. Otherwise a vessel with water is placed in
the sanctuary.<br class="wordsection"/>
Catechumens, if there are any, are called forward and presented by their
godparents in front of the assembled Church or, if they are small children, are
carried by their parents and godparents.<br class="wordsection"/>
Then, if there is to be a procession to the baptistery or to the font, it forms
immediately. A minister with the paschal candle leads off, and those to be
baptised follow him with their godparents, then the ministers, the Deacon, and
the Priest. During the procession, the Litany (no. 43) is sung. When the Litany
is completed, the Priest gives the address (no. 40).</p>

<p class="rubric">If, however, the Baptismal
Liturgy takes place in the sanctuary, the Priest immediately makes an
introductory statement in these or similar words.<br class="wordsection"/>
If there are candidates to be baptised:</p>

<p class="calibre6"><p class="calibre6"> </p></p>

<p class="calibre6">Dearly beloved,<br class="wordsection"/>
with one heart and one soul, let us by our prayers <br class="wordsection"/>
come to the aid of these our brothers and sisters in their blessed hope, <br class="wordsection"/>
so that, as they approach the font of rebirth,<br class="wordsection"/>
the almighty Father may bestow on them<br class="wordsection"/>
all his merciful help.</p>

<p class="rubric">If the font is to be blessed,
but no one is to be baptised:</p>

<p class="calibre6">Dearly beloved,<br class="wordsection"/>
let us humbly invoke upon this font<br class="wordsection"/>
the grace of God the almighty Father,<br class="wordsection"/>
that those who from it are born anew<br class="wordsection"/>
may be numbered among the children of adoption in Christ.</p>

<p class="rubric">The Litany is sung by two
cantors, with all standing (because it is Easter Time) and responding.<br class="wordsection"/>
If, however, there is to be a procession of some length to the baptistery, the
Litany is sung during the procession; in this case, those to be baptised are
called forward before the procession begins, and the procession takes place led
by the paschal candle, followed by the catechumens with their godparents, then
the ministers, the Deacon, and the Priest. The address should occur before the
Blessing of Water.</p>

<p class="rubric">If no one is to be baptised and
the font is not to be blessed, the Litany is omitted, and the <a href="#BOW">Blessing of Water (no. 54)</a> takes place at once.</p>

<p class="rubric">In the Litany the names of some
Saints may be added, especially the Titular Saint of the church and the Patron
Saints of the place and of those to be baptised.</p>

<p class="anth">Lord, have mercy. | Lord, have mercy.<br class="wordsection"/>

<p class="rubric">If there are candidates to be
baptised:</p>

<p class="anth">Bring these chosen ones to new birth through the grace of Baptism<br class="wordsection"/>
R. Lord, we ask you, hear our prayer.</p>

<p class="rubric">If there are no candidates to be
baptised:</p>

<p class="anth">Make this font holy by your grace<br class="wordsection"/>

Christ, hear us. | Christ, hear us.<br class="wordsection"/>
Christ, graciously hear us. Christ, graciously hear us.</p>

<p class="rubric">If there are candidates to be
baptised, the Priest, with hands extended, says the following prayer:</p>

<p class="calibre6">Almighty ever-living God,<br class="wordsection"/>
be present by the mysteries of your great love<br class="wordsection"/>
and send forth the spirit of adoption<br class="wordsection"/>
to create the new peoples<br class="wordsection"/>
brought to birth for you in the font of Baptism,<br class="wordsection"/>
so that what is to be carried out by our humble service<br class="wordsection"/>
may be brought to fulfillment by your mighty power.</p>

<p class="calibre6">Through Christ our Lord. </p>

<p class="response">Amen.</p>

<h3 class="calibre2">Blessing of Baptismal Water</h3>

<p class="calibre6">Text without music: [or <a href="#BOW">Blessing of Water</a>]</p>

<p class="rubric">The Priest then blesses the
baptismal water, saying the following prayer with hands extended:</p>

<p class="calibre6">O God, who by invisible power<br class="wordsection"/>
accomplish a wondrous effect<br class="wordsection"/>
through sacramental signs<br class="wordsection"/>
and who in many ways have prepared water, your creation, <br class="wordsection"/>
to show forth the grace of Baptism;</p>

<p class="calibre6">O God, whose Spirit<br class="wordsection"/>
in the first moments of the world’s creation hovered over the waters,<br class="wordsection"/>
so that the very substance of water<br class="wordsection"/>
would even then take to itself the power to sanctify;</p>

<p class="calibre6">O God, who by the outpouring of the flood<br class="wordsection"/>
foreshadowed regeneration,<br class="wordsection"/>
so that from the mystery of one and the same element of water <br class="wordsection"/>
would come an end to vice and a beginning of virtue;</p>

<p class="calibre6">O God, who caused the children of Abraham <br class="wordsection"/>
to pass dry-shod through the Red Sea,<br class="wordsection"/>
so that the chosen people,<br class="wordsection"/>
set free from slavery to Pharaoh,<br class="wordsection"/>
would prefigure the people of the baptised;</p>

<p class="calibre6">O God, whose Son,<br class="wordsection"/>
baptised by John in the waters of the Jordan,<br class="wordsection"/>
was anointed with the Holy Spirit,<br class="wordsection"/>
and, as he hung upon the Cross,<br class="wordsection"/>
gave forth water from his side along with blood,<br class="wordsection"/>
and after his Resurrection, commanded his disciples:</p>

<p class="calibre6">“Go forth, teach all nations, baptising them<br class="wordsection"/>
in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit,” <br class="wordsection"/>
look now, we pray, upon the face of your Church<br class="wordsection"/>
and graciously unseal for her the fountain of Baptism.</p>

<p class="calibre6">May this water receive by the Holy Spirit<br class="wordsection"/>
the grace of your Only Begotten Son,<br class="wordsection"/>
so that human nature, created in your image<br class="wordsection"/>
and washed clean through the Sacrament of Baptism <br class="wordsection"/>
from all the squalor of the life of old,<br class="wordsection"/>
may be found worthy to rise to the life of newborn children <br class="wordsection"/>
through water and the Holy Spirit.</p>

<p class="rubric">And, if appropriate, lowering
the paschal candle into the water either once or three times, he continues:</p>

<p class="calibre6">May the power of the Holy Spirit, O Lord, we
pray,<br class="wordsection"/>
come down through your Son <br class="wordsection"/>
into the fullness of this font,</p>

<p class="rubric">and, holding the candle in the
water, he continues:</p>

<p class="calibre6">so that all who have been buried with Christ<br class="wordsection"/>
by Baptism into death may rise again to life with him.<br class="wordsection"/>
Who lives and reigns with you in the unity of the Holy Spirit, <br class="wordsection"/>
one God, for ever and ever.</p>

<p class="response">Amen.</p>

<p class="rubric">Then the candle is lifted out of the water, as the people acclaim:</p>

<p class="calibre6">Springs of water, bless the Lord;<br class="wordsection"/>
praise and exalt him above all for ever.</p>

<p class="rubric">After the blessing of baptismal
water and the acclamation of the people, the Priest, standing, puts the
prescribed questions to the adults and the parents or godparents of the
children, as is set out in the respective Rites of the Roman Ritual, in order
for them to make the required renunciation.</p>

<p class="rubric">If the anointing of the adults
with the Oil of Catechumens has not taken place beforehand, as part of the
immediately preparatory rites, it occurs at this moment.</p>

<p class="rubric">Then the Priest questions the
adults individually about the faith and, if there are children to be baptised,
he requests the triple profession of faith from all the parents and godparents
together, as is indicated in the respective Rites.</p>

<p class="rubric">Where many are to be baptised on
this night, it is possible to arrange the rite so that, immediately after the
response of those to be baptised and of the godparents and the parents, the
Celebrant asks for and receives the renewal of baptismal promises of all
present.</p>

<p class="rubric">When the interrogation is
concluded, the Priest baptises the adult elect and the children.<br class="wordsection"/>
After the Baptism, the Priest anoints the infants with chrism. A white garment
is given to each, whether adults or children. Then the Priest or Deacon
receives the paschal candle from the hand of the minister, and the candles of the newly baptised are lighted. For infants the rite of Ephphetha is omitted.</p>

<p class="rubric">Afterwards, unless the baptismal
washing and the other explanatory rites have occurred in the sanctuary, a
procession returns to the sanctuary, formed as before, with the newly baptised
or the godparents or parents carrying lighted candles. During this procession,
the baptismal canticle Vidi aquam (I saw water) or another appropriate chant is
sung (no. 56).</p>

<p class="rubric">If adults have been baptised,
the Bishop or, in his absence, the Priest who has conferred Baptism, should at
once administer the Sacrament of Confirmation to them in the sanctuary, as is
indicated in the Roman Pontifical or Roman Ritual.</p>

<h3 class="calibre2"><a class="calibre3" id="BOW"></a>The Blessing of Water</h3>

<p class="calibre6">Text without music: [or <a href="#RBP">Renewal of Baptismal Promises</a>]</p>

<p class="rubric">54. If no one present is to be
baptised and the font is not to be blessed, the Priest introduces the faithful
to the blessing of water, saying:</p>

<p class="calibre6">Dear brothers and sisters,<br class="wordsection"/>
let us humbly beseech the Lord our God <br class="wordsection"/>
to bless this water he has created,<br class="wordsection"/>
which will be sprinkled upon us<br class="wordsection"/>
as a memorial of our Baptism.<br class="wordsection"/>
May he graciously renew us,<br class="wordsection"/>
that we may remain faithful to the Spirit whom we have received.</p>

<p class="rubric">And after a brief pause in
silence, he proclaims the following prayer, with hands extended:</p>

<p class="calibre6">Lord our God,<br class="wordsection"/>
in your mercy be present to your people<br class="wordsection"/>
who keep vigil on this most sacred night,<br class="wordsection"/>
and, for us who recall the wondrous work of our creation <br class="wordsection"/>
and the still greater work of our redemption,<br class="wordsection"/>
graciously bless this water.</p>

<p class="calibre6">For you created water to make the fields
fruitful <br class="wordsection"/>
and to refresh and cleanse our bodies.<br class="wordsection"/>
You also made water the instrument of your mercy: <br class="wordsection"/>
for through water you freed your people from slavery <br class="wordsection"/>
and quenched their thirst in the desert;<br class="wordsection"/>
through water the Prophets proclaimed the new covenant <br class="wordsection"/>
you were to enter upon with the human race;<br class="wordsection"/>
and last of all,<br class="wordsection"/>
through water, which Christ made holy in the Jordan, <br class="wordsection"/>
you have renewed our corrupted nature<br class="wordsection"/>
in the bath of regeneration.</p>

<p class="calibre6">Therefore, may this water be for us<br class="wordsection"/>
a memorial of the Baptism we have received, <br class="wordsection"/>
and grant that we may share<br class="wordsection"/>
in the gladness of our brothers and sisters, <br class="wordsection"/>
who at Easter have received their Baptism. </p>

<p class="calibre6">Through Christ our Lord.</p>

<p class="response">Amen.</p>

<h3 class="calibre2"><a class="calibre3" id="RBP"></a>The Renewal of Baptismal Promises</h3>

<p class="rubric">55. When the Rite of Baptism
(and Confirmation) has been completed or, if this has not taken place, after
the blessing of water, all stand, holding lighted candles in their hands, and
renew the promise of baptismal faith, unless this has already been done
together with those to be baptised (cf. no. 49).<br class="wordsection"/>
The Priest addresses the faithful in these or similar words:</p>

<p class="calibre6">Dear brethren (brothers and sisters), <br class="wordsection"/>
through the Paschal Mystery we have been buried with Christ in Baptism,<br class="wordsection"/>
so that we may walk with him in newness of life.<br class="wordsection"/>
And so, now that our Lenten observance is concluded,<br class="wordsection"/>
let us renew the promises of Holy Baptism,<br class="wordsection"/>
by which we once renounced Satan and his works<br class="wordsection"/>
and promised to serve God in the holy Catholic Church. </p>

<p class="calibre6">And so I ask you:<br class="wordsection"/>
Priest: Do you renounce Satan?</p>

<p class="response">All: I do.</p>

<p class="calibre6">Priest: And all his works?</p>

<p class="response">All: I do.</p>

<p class="calibre6">Priest: And all his empty show?</p>

<p class="response">All: I do.</p>

<p class="rubric">Or:</p>

<p class="calibre6">Priest: Do you renounce sin, <br class="wordsection"/>
so as to live in the freedom of the children of God? </p>

<p class="response">All: I do.</p>

<p class="calibre6">Priest: Do you renounce the lure of evil, <br class="wordsection"/>
so that sin may have no mastery over you?</p>

<p class="response">All: I do.</p>

<p class="calibre6">Priest: Do you renounce Satan, the author and
prince of sin? </p>

<p class="response">All: I do.</p>

<p class="rubric">If the situation warrants, this
second formula may be adapted by Conferences of Bishops according to local
needs.<br class="wordsection"/>
Then the Priest continues:</p>

<p class="calibre6">Priest: Do you believe in God, the Father
almighty, <br class="wordsection"/>
Creator of heaven and earth? </p>

<p class="response">All: I do.</p>

<p class="calibre6">Priest: Do you believe in Jesus Christ, his
only Son, our Lord, <br class="wordsection"/>
who was born of the Virgin Mary, <br class="wordsection"/>
suffered death and was buried, <br class="wordsection"/>
rose again from the dead <br class="wordsection"/>
and is seated at the right hand of the Father?</p>

<p class="response">All: I do.</p>

<p class="calibre6">Priest: Do you believe in the Holy Spirit, <br class="wordsection"/>
the holy Catholic Church, the communion of saints, <br class="wordsection"/>
the forgiveness of sins, the resurrection of the body, <br class="wordsection"/>
and life everlasting?</p>

<p class="response">All: I do.</p>

<p class="rubric">And the Priest concludes:</p>

<p class="calibre6">And may almighty God, <br class="wordsection"/>
the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, <br class="wordsection"/>
who has given us new birth by water and the Holy Spirit <br class="wordsection"/>
and bestowed on us forgiveness of our sins,<br class="wordsection"/>
keep us by his grace,<br class="wordsection"/>
in Christ Jesus our Lord,<br class="wordsection"/>
for eternal life.</p>

<p class="response">All: Amen.</p>

<p class="rubric">56. The Priest sprinkles the
people with the blessed water, while all sing: </p>

<p class="anth">Antiphon</p>

<p class="calibre6">I saw water flowing from the Temple, from its
right-hand side, alleluia;<br class="wordsection"/>
and all to whom this water came were saved and shall say: Alleluia, alleluia.</p>

<p class="rubric">Another chant that is baptismal
in character may also be sung.<br class="wordsection"/>
Meanwhile the newly baptised are led to their place among the faithful. If the
blessing of baptismal water has not taken place in the baptistery, the Deacon
and the ministers reverently carry the vessel of water to the font.</p>

<p class="rubric">If the blessing of the font has
not occurred, the blessed water is put aside in an appropriate place.<br class="wordsection"/>
After the sprinkling, the Priest returns to the chair where, omitting the
Creed, he directs the Universal Prayer, in which the newly baptised participate
for the first time.</p>
