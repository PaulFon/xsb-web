<h3 class="calibre2">The fruits of the Most Holy Eucharist</h3>

<p class="rubric">61. The following Preface is
said on the Solemnity of the Most Holy Body and Blood of Christ (Corpus
Christi) and in Votive Masses of the Most Holy Eucharist. </p>

<p class="calibre6">The Lord be with you.</p>

<p class="response">And with your spirit.</p>

<p class="calibre6">Lift up your hearts.</p>

<p class="response">We lift them up to the Lord.</p>

<p class="calibre6">Let us give thanks to the Lord our God.</p>

<p class="response">It is right and just.</p>

<p class="calibre6">It is truly right and just, our duty and our
salvation, always and everywhere to give you thanks, Lord, holy Father, almighty
and eternal God, through Christ our Lord. </p>

<p class="calibre6">For at the Last Supper with his Apostles,
establishing for the ages to come the saving memorial of the Cross, he offered
himself to you as the unblemished Lamb, the acceptable gift of perfect praise. </p>

<p class="calibre6">Nourishing your faithful by this sacred
mystery, you make them holy, so that the human race, bounded by one world, may
be enlightened by one faith and united by one bond of charity. </p>

<p class="calibre6">And so, we approach the table of this
wondrous Sacrament, so that, bathed in the sweetness of your grace, we may pass
over to the heavenly realities here foreshadowed. </p>

<p class="calibre6">Therefore, all creatures of heaven and earth
sing a new song in adoration, and we, with all the host of Angels, cry out, and
without end we acclaim: </p>

<p class="all">Holy, Holy, Holy Lord God of hosts.
Heaven and earth are full of your glory. Hosanna in the highest. Blessed is he
who comes in the name of the Lord. Hosanna in the highest.</p>
