The Priest, with hands extended, says: </p>

<p class="calibre6">You are indeed Holy, O Lord, <br class="wordsection"/>
and all you have created rightly gives you praise, <br class="wordsection"/>
for through your Son our Lord Jesus Christ, <br class="wordsection"/>
by the power and working of the Holy Spirit, <br class="wordsection"/>
you give life to all things and make them holy, <br class="wordsection"/>
and you never cease to gather a people to yourself, <br class="wordsection"/>
so that from the rising of the sun to its setting <br class="wordsection"/>
a pure sacrifice may be offered to your name. </p>

<p class="rubric"><img border="0" id="_x0000_i1177" src="cc.gif" class="calibre12"/>109.
He joins his hands and, holding them extended over the offerings, says: </p>

<p class="calibre6">Therefore, O Lord, we humbly implore you: <br class="wordsection"/>
by the same Spirit graciously make holy these gifts <br class="wordsection"/>
we have brought to you for consecration, </p>

<p class="rubric">He joins his hands and makes the
Sign of the Cross once over the bread and chalice together, saying: </p>

<p class="calibre6">that they may become <br class="wordsection"/>
the Body and <span class="red1">+</span> Blood of your Son our Lord Jesus Christ, </p>

<p class="rubric">He joins his hands. </p>

<p class="calibre6">at whose command we celebrate these
mysteries. </p>

<p class="rubric">110. In the formulas that
follow, the words of the Lord should be pronounced clearly and distinctly, as
the nature of these words requires. </p>

<p class="calibre6">For on the night he was betrayed </p>

<p class="rubric">He takes the bread and, holding
it slightly raised above the altar, continues: </p>

<p class="calibre6">he himself took bread, and, giving you
thanks, <br class="wordsection"/>
he said the blessing, <br class="wordsection"/>
broke the bread and gave it to his disciples, saying: </p>

<p class="rubric">He bows slightly. </p>

<p class="calibre6">TAKE THIS, ALL OF YOU, AND EAT OF IT, <br class="wordsection"/>
FOR THIS IS MY BODY, WHICH WILL BE GIVEN UP FOR YOU.</p>

<p class="rubric">He shows the consecrated host to
the people, places it again on the paten, and genuflects in adoration. After
this, he continues: </p>

<p class="calibre6">In a similar way, when supper was ended, </p>

<p class="rubric">He takes the chalice and,
holding it slightly raised above the altar, continues: </p>

<p class="calibre6">he took the chalice, and, giving you thanks,
he said the blessing, and gave the chalice to his disciples, saying: </p>

<p class="rubric">He bows slightly. </p>

<p class="calibre6">TAKE THIS, ALL OF YOU, AND DRINK FROM IT, <br class="wordsection"/>
FOR THIS IS THE CHALICE OF MY BLOOD, <br class="wordsection"/>
THE BLOOD OF THE NEW AND ETERNAL COVENANT, <br class="wordsection"/>
WHICH WILL BE POURED OUT FOR YOU <br class="wordsection"/>
AND FOR MANY FOR THE FORGIVENESS OF SINS. </p>

<p class="calibre6">DO THIS IN MEMORY OF ME. </p>

<p class="rubric">He shows the chalice to the
people, places it on the corporal, and genuflects in adoration. </p>

<p class="rubric"><img border="0" id="_x0000_i1176" src="pc.gif" class="calibre12"/>112.
Then he says: </p>

<p class="calibre6">The mystery of faith. </p>

<p class="rubric">And the people continue,
acclaiming: </p>

<p class="response">We proclaim your Death, O
Lord, <br class="wordsection"/>
and profess your Resurrection until you come again. </p>

<p class="rubric">or: </p>

<p class="response">When we eat this Bread and
drink this Cup, <br class="wordsection"/>
we proclaim your Death, O Lord, until you come again. </p>

<p class="rubric">or: </p>

<p class="response">Save us, Saviour of the world,
<br class="wordsection"/>
for by your Cross and Resurrection you have set us free. </p>

<p class="rubric"><img border="0" id="_x0000_i1175" src="cc.gif" class="calibre12"/>113.
Then the Priest, with hands extended, says: </p>

<p class="calibre6">Therefore, O Lord, as we celebrate the
memorial of the saving Passion of your Son, his wondrous Resurrection and
Ascension into heaven, and as we look forward to his second coming, we offer
you in thanksgiving this holy and living sacrifice. </p>

<p class="calibre6">Look, we pray, upon the oblation of your
Church and, recognizing the sacrificial Victim by whose death you willed to
reconcile us to yourself, grant that we, who are nourished by the Body and
Blood of your Son and filled with his Holy Spirit, may become one body, one
spirit in Christ. </p>

<p class="calibre6"><img border="0" id="_x0000_i1174" src="c1.gif" class="calibre12"/>May he make
of us an eternal offering to you, <br class="wordsection"/>
so that we may obtain an inheritance with your elect, <br class="wordsection"/>
especially with the most Blessed Virgin Mary, Mother of God, with blessed
Joseph, her Spouse, <br class="wordsection"/>
with your blessed Apostles and glorious Martyrs <br class="wordsection"/>
<span class="red1">(</span>with Saint <span class="red1">N.</span> - the Saint of the day or Patron Saint<span class="red1">)</span><br class="wordsection"/>
and with all the Saints, <br class="wordsection"/>
on whose constant intercession in your presence <br class="wordsection"/>
we rely for unfailing help. </p>

<p class="calibre6"><img border="0" id="_x0000_i1173" src="c2.gif" class="calibre12"/>May this
Sacrifice of our reconciliation, we pray, O Lord,<br class="wordsection"/>
advance the peace and salvation of all the world. <br class="wordsection"/>
Be pleased to confirm in faith and charity <br class="wordsection"/>
your pilgrim Church on earth, <br class="wordsection"/>
with your servant <span class="red1">Francis</span> our Pope and <span class="red1">N.</span> our
Bishop, <br class="wordsection"/>
the Order of Bishops, all the clergy, <br class="wordsection"/>
and the entire people you have gained for your own. </p>

<p class="calibre6">Listen graciously to the prayers of this family,
<br class="wordsection"/>
whom you have summoned before you: <br class="wordsection"/>
in your compassion, O merciful Father, <br class="wordsection"/>
gather to yourself all your children <br class="wordsection"/>
scattered throughout the world. </p>

<p class="response"><a href="iPriest%20Roman%20Missal%20SE%20USA%20-%20Roman%20Missal%20ICEL_split_328.htm#EP3D1">In Masses for the Dead.</a></p>

<p class="calibre6"><img border="0" id="_x0000_i1172" src="c3.gif" class="calibre12"/>To our
departed brothers and sisters <br class="wordsection"/>
and to all who were pleasing to you at their passing from this life, give kind
admittance to your kingdom. <br class="wordsection"/>
There we hope to enjoy for ever the fullness of your glory </p>

<p class="rubric">He joins his hands. </p>

<p class="calibre6">through Christ our Lord, <br class="wordsection"/>
through whom you bestow on the world all that is good. </p>

<p class="rubric"><img border="0" id="_x0000_i1171" src="pcc.gif" class="calibre12"/>114.
He takes the chalice and the paten with the host and, raising both, he says: </p>

<p class="calibre6">Through him, and with him, and in him, <br class="wordsection"/>
O God, almighty Father, <br class="wordsection"/>
in the unity of the Holy Spirit, <br class="wordsection"/>
all glory and honour is yours, <br class="wordsection"/>
for ever and ever.</p>

<p class="rubric">The people acclaim: </p>

<p class="response">Amen. | <a href="iPriest%20Roman%20Missal%20SE%20USA%20-%20Roman%20Missal%20ICEL_split_347.htm#CR">Then follows the Communion Rite.</a></p>
