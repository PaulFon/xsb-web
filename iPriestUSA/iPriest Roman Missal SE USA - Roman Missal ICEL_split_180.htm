<p class="calibre6">O God, Father of mercies,<br class="wordsection"/>

as he hung upon the Cross, <br class="wordsection"/>
chose the Blessed Virgin Mary, his Mother,<br class="wordsection"/>
to be our Mother also;<br class="wordsection"/>

<h3 class="calibre2">Prayer over the Offerings</h3>

<p class="calibre6">Receive our offerings, O Lord,<br class="wordsection"/>
and transform them into the mystery of salvation, <br class="wordsection"/>
so that by its power we may be set aflame<br class="wordsection"/>
with the charity of the Virgin Mary, <br class="wordsection"/>
Mother of the Church, <br class="wordsection"/>
and with her may be united more closely<br class="wordsection"/>
to the work of redemption.</p>

<p class="calibre6">Through Christ our Lord.</p>

<h3 class="calibre2"><a class="calibre3" id="P91"></a>Preface: Mary, pattern and Mother of the Church.</h3>

<p class="calibre6">The Lord be with you.</p>

<p class="response">And with your spirit.</p>

<p class="calibre6">Lift up your hearts.</p>

<p class="response">We lift them up to the Lord.</p>

<p class="calibre6">Let us give thanks to the Lord our God.</p>

<p class="response">It is right and just.</p>

<p class="calibre6">It is truly right and just, our duty and our salvation, <br class="wordsection"/>
always and everywhere to give you thanks,<br class="wordsection"/>
Lord, holy Father, almighty and eternal God, <br class="wordsection"/>
and to proclaim your greatness with due praise <br class="wordsection"/>
as we honour the Blessed Virgin Mary.</p>

<p class="calibre6">Receiving your Word in her Immaculate Heart,<br class="wordsection"/>
she was found worthy to conceive him in her virgin’s womb <br class="wordsection"/>
and, giving birth to the Creator,<br class="wordsection"/>
she nurtured the beginnings of the Church.</p>

<p class="calibre6">Standing beside the Cross,<br class="wordsection"/>
she received the testament of divine love <br class="wordsection"/>
and took to herself as sons and daughters <br class="wordsection"/>
all those who by the Death of Christ<br class="wordsection"/>
are born to heavenly life.<br class="wordsection"/>
As the Apostles awaited the Spirit you had promised, <br class="wordsection"/>
she joined her supplication to the prayers of the disciples <br class="wordsection"/>
and so became the pattern of the Church at prayer.</p>

<p class="calibre6">Raised to the glory of heaven,<br class="wordsection"/>
she accompanies your pilgrim Church with a mother’s love, <br class="wordsection"/>
and watches in kindness over the Church’s homeward steps, <br class="wordsection"/>
until the Lord’s Day shall come in glorious splendour.</p>

<p class="calibre6">And so, with all the Angels and Saints, <br class="wordsection"/>
we praise you as without end we acclaim:</p>

<p class="all">Holy, Holy, Holy Lord God of hosts. Heaven and earth
are full of your glory. Hosanna in the highest. Blessed is he who comes in the
name of the Lord. Hosanna in the highest.</p>

<h3 class="calibre2">Prayer after Communion</h3>

<p class="calibre6">Having received the pledge of redemption and of life <br class="wordsection"/>
we humbly pray, O Lord,<br class="wordsection"/>
that, with the Blessed Virgin’s motherly help, <br class="wordsection"/>
your Church may teach all nations<br class="wordsection"/>
by proclaiming the Gospel<br class="wordsection"/>
and, thanks to the outpouring of the Spirit,<br class="wordsection"/>
may fill the whole earth.</p>
