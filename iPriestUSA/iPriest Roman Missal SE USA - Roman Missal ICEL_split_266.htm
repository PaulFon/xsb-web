<h2 id="calibre_toc_300" class="calibre10"><a class="calibre3" id="P04"></a>PREFACE II OF THE NATIVITY OF THE LORD </h2>

<h3 class="calibre2">The restoration of all things in the Incarnation</h3>

<p class="rubric">36. The following Preface is
said in Masses of the Nativity of the Lord and of its Octave Day, and within
the Octave, even in Masses that otherwise might have a proper Preface, with the
exception of Masses that have a proper Preface concerning the divine mysteries
or divine Persons. It is also used on weekdays of Christmas Time. </p>

<p class="calibre6">The Lord be with you.</p>

<p class="response">And with your spirit.</p>

<p class="calibre6">Lift up your hearts.</p>

<p class="response">We lift them up to the Lord.</p>

<p class="calibre6">Let us give thanks to the Lord our God.</p>

<p class="response">It is right and just.</p>

<p class="calibre6">It is truly right and just, our duty and our
salvation, always and everywhere to give you thanks, Lord, holy Father,
almighty and eternal God, through Christ our Lord. </p>

<p class="calibre6">For on the feast of this awe-filled mystery,
though invisible in his own divine nature, he has appeared visibly in ours; and
begotten before all ages, he has begun to exist in time; so that, raising up in
himself all that was cast down, he might restore unity to all creation and call
straying humanity back to the heavenly Kingdom. </p>

<p class="calibre6">And so, with all the Angels, we praise you,
as in joyful celebration we acclaim: </p>

<p class="all">Holy, Holy, Holy Lord God of hosts.
Heaven and earth are full of your glory. Hosanna in the highest. Blessed is he
who comes in the name of the Lord. Hosanna in the highest.</p>
