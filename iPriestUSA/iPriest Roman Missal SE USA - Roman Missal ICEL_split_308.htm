<h3 class="calibre2">Praise to God for the creation and restoration of the human race</h3>

<p class="rubric">74. The following Preface is
said in Masses that have no proper Preface, and for which a Preface related to
a specific liturgical time is not indicated.</p>

<p class="calibre6">The Lord be with you.</p>

<p class="response">And with your spirit.</p>

<p class="calibre6">Lift up your hearts.</p>

<p class="response">We lift them up to the Lord.</p>

<p class="calibre6">Let us give thanks to the Lord our God.</p>

<p class="response">It is right and just.</p>

<p class="calibre6">It is truly right and just, our duty and our
salvation, always and everywhere to give you thanks, Lord, holy Father,
almighty and eternal God. </p>

<p class="calibre6">For just as through your beloved Son you
created the human race, so also through him with great goodness you formed it
anew. And so, it is right that all your creatures serve you, all the redeemed
praise you, and all your Saints with one heart bless you. </p>

<p class="calibre6">Therefore, we, too, extol you with all the
Angels, as in joyful celebration we acclaim: </p>

<p class="all">Holy, Holy, Holy Lord God of hosts.
Heaven and earth are full of your glory. Hosanna in the highest. Blessed is he
who comes in the name of the Lord. Hosanna in the highest.</p>
