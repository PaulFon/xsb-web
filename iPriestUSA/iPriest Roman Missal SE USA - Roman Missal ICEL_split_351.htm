<p class="rubric">The following prayers may be used, at
the discretion of the Priest, at the end of the celebration of Mass, or of a
Liturgy of the Word, or of the Office, or of the Sacraments. </p>

<p class="rubric">The Deacon or, in his absence, the
Priest himself, says the invitation: Bow down for the blessing. Then the
Priest, with hands outstretched over the people, says the prayer, with all
responding: Amen. </p>

<p class="rubric">After the prayer, the Priest always
adds: </p>

<p class="calibre6">And may the blessing of almighty God, <br class="wordsection"/>
the Father, and the Son, <span class="red1">+</span> and the Holy Spirit, <br class="wordsection"/>
come down on you and remain with you for ever. </p>

<p class="response">Amen. </p>

<p class="calibre6">1. Be gracious to your people, O Lord, <br class="wordsection"/>
and do not withhold consolation on earth <br class="wordsection"/>
from those you call to strive for heaven. <br class="wordsection"/>
Through Christ our Lord. </p>

<p class="calibre6">2. Grant, O Lord, we pray, <br class="wordsection"/>
that the Christian people may understand the truths they profess <br class="wordsection"/>
and love the heavenly liturgy in which they participate. <br class="wordsection"/>
Through Christ our Lord. </p>

<p class="calibre6">3. May your people receive your holy blessing, <br class="wordsection"/>
O Lord, we pray, and, by that gift, <br class="wordsection"/>
spurn all that would harm them and obtain what they desire. <br class="wordsection"/>
Through Christ our Lord. </p>

<p class="calibre6">4. Turn your people to you with all their heart, <br class="wordsection"/>
O Lord, we pray, for you protect even those who go astray, <br class="wordsection"/>
but when they serve you with undivided heart, <br class="wordsection"/>
you sustain them with still greater care. <br class="wordsection"/>
Through Christ our Lord. </p>

<p class="calibre6">5. Graciously enlighten your family, O Lord, we pray, <br class="wordsection"/>
that by holding fast to what is pleasing to you, <br class="wordsection"/>
they may be worthy to accomplish all that is good. <br class="wordsection"/>
Through Christ our Lord. </p>

<p class="calibre6">6. Bestow pardon and peace, O Lord, we pray, <br class="wordsection"/>

<p class="calibre6">8. Be propitious to your people, O God, that, <br class="wordsection"/>

and ever stand firm under your protection. <br class="wordsection"/>
Through Christ our Lord. </p>

<p class="calibre6">9. May your family always rejoice together, O God, <br class="wordsection"/>
over the mysteries of redemption they have celebrated, <br class="wordsection"/>

to attain the effects that flow from them. <br class="wordsection"/>
Through Christ our Lord. </p>

<p class="calibre6">10. Lord God, from the abundance of your mercies <br class="wordsection"/>
provide for your servants and ensure their safety, <br class="wordsection"/>
so that, strengthened by your blessings, <br class="wordsection"/>
they may at all times abound in thanksgiving <br class="wordsection"/>
and bless you with unending exultation. <br class="wordsection"/>
Through Christ our Lord. </p>

<p class="calibre6">11. Keep your family, we pray, O Lord, in your constant care,
<br class="wordsection"/>

to carry out works of charity. <br class="wordsection"/>
Through Christ our Lord. </p>

<p class="calibre6">14. The hearts of your faithful submitted to your name, <br class="wordsection"/>
entreat your help, O Lord, <br class="wordsection"/>
and since without you they can do nothing that is just, <br class="wordsection"/>
grant by your abundant mercy <br class="wordsection"/>
that they may both know what is right <br class="wordsection"/>
and receive all that they need for their good. <br class="wordsection"/>
Through Christ our Lord. </p>

<p class="calibre6">15. Hasten to the aid of your faithful people <br class="wordsection"/>
who call upon you, O Lord, we pray, <br class="wordsection"/>
and graciously give strength in their human weakness, <br class="wordsection"/>
so that, being dedicated to you in complete sincerity, <br class="wordsection"/>
they may find gladness in your remedies <br class="wordsection"/>
both now and in the life to come. <br class="wordsection"/>
Through Christ our Lord. </p>

<p class="calibre6">16. Look with favour on your family, O Lord, <br class="wordsection"/>
and bestow your endless mercy on those who seek it: <br class="wordsection"/>
and just as without your mercy, <br class="wordsection"/>
they can do nothing truly worthy of you, <br class="wordsection"/>
so through it, may they merit to obey your saving commands. <br class="wordsection"/>
Through Christ our Lord. </p>

<p class="calibre6">17. Bestow increase of heavenly grace on your faithful, O
Lord; <br class="wordsection"/>

may our whole lives be yours. <br class="wordsection"/>
Through Christ our Lord. </p>

<p class="calibre6">18. Direct your people, O Lord, we pray, <br class="wordsection"/>

having enough for their needs in this world, <br class="wordsection"/>
they may be made full heirs of your promise for eternity. <br class="wordsection"/>
Through Christ our Lord. </p>

<p class="calibre6">20. Bestow the grace of your kindness <br class="wordsection"/>
upon your supplicant people, O Lord, <br class="wordsection"/>
that, formed by you, their creator, <br class="wordsection"/>
and restored by you, their sustainer, <br class="wordsection"/>
through your constant action they may be saved. <br class="wordsection"/>
Through Christ our Lord. </p>

<p class="calibre6">21. May your faithful people, O Lord, we pray, <br class="wordsection"/>
always respond to the promptings of your love <br class="wordsection"/>

may they do gladly what you command, <br class="wordsection"/>
so as to receive the things you promise. <br class="wordsection"/>
Through Christ our Lord. </p>

<p class="calibre6">22. May the weakness of your devoted people <br class="wordsection"/>
stir your compassion, O Lord, we pray, <br class="wordsection"/>
and let their faithful pleading win your mercy, <br class="wordsection"/>
that what they do not presume upon by their merits <br class="wordsection"/>
they may receive by your generous pardon. <br class="wordsection"/>
Through Christ our Lord. </p>

<p class="calibre6">23. In defense of your children, O Lord, we pray, <br class="wordsection"/>
stretch forth the right hand of your majesty, <br class="wordsection"/>
so that, obeying your fatherly will, <br class="wordsection"/>
they may have the unfailing protection of your fatherly care. <br class="wordsection"/>
Through Christ our Lord. </p>

<p class="calibre6">24. Look, O Lord, on the prayers of your family, <br class="wordsection"/>

so that, strengthened by the help they need, <br class="wordsection"/>
they may persevere in confessing your name. <br class="wordsection"/>
Through Christ our Lord. </p>

<p class="calibre6">25. Keep your family safe, O Lord, we pray, <br class="wordsection"/>

that they may find growth through the teachings <br class="wordsection"/>
and the gifts of heaven. <br class="wordsection"/>
Through Christ our Lord. </p>

<p class="calibre6">26. May your faithful people rejoice, we pray, O Lord, <br class="wordsection"/>
to be upheld up by your right hand, <br class="wordsection"/>
and, progressing in the Christian life, <br class="wordsection"/>
may they delight in good things <br class="wordsection"/>
both now and in the time to come. <br class="wordsection"/>
Through Christ our Lord. </p>

<h3 class="calibre2">On Feasts of Saints </h3>

<p class="calibre6">27. May the Christian people exult, O Lord, <br class="wordsection"/>
at the glorification of the illustrious members of your Son’s Body, <br class="wordsection"/>
and may they gain a share in the eternal lot of the Saints <br class="wordsection"/>
on whose feast day they reaffirm their devotion to you, <br class="wordsection"/>
rejoicing with them for ever in your glory. <br class="wordsection"/>
Through Christ our Lord. </p>
