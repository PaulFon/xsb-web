RITE OF DEPUTING A MINISTER<br class="calibre4"/>
TO DISTRIBUTE HOLY COMMUNION<br class="calibre4"/>
ON A SINGLE OCCASION</h2>

<p class="rubric">1. The Diocesan Bishop has the
faculty to permit individual Priests, exercising sacred duties, to depute a
suitable member of the faithful to distribute Holy Communion with them on a
single occasion, in cases of real necessity.<br class="wordsection"/>
2. When one of the faithful is deputed to distribute Communion on a single occasion
in such cases, it is fitting that a mandate to do so should be conferred according
to the following rite.<br class="wordsection"/>
3. After the Priest Celebrant himself has received the Sacrament in the usual
way, the extraordinary minister comes to the altar and stands before the
Celebrant, who blesses him or her with these words:</p>

<p class="calibre6">May the Lord <span class="red1">+</span> bless
you<br class="wordsection"/>
so that at this Mass you may minister <br class="wordsection"/>
the Body and Blood of Christ<br class="wordsection"/>
to your brothers and sisters.</p>

<p class="rubric">And he or she replies:</p>

<p class="response">Amen.</p>

<p class="rubric">4. If the extraordinary minister
is to receive the Most Holy Eucharist, the Priest gives Communion to the
minister. Then the Priest gives him or her the ciborium or vessel with the
hosts or the chalice and together they go to administer Communion to the
faithful.</p>
