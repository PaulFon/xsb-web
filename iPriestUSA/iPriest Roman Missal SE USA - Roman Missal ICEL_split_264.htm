<h3 class="calibre2">The twofold expectation of Christ</h3>

<p class="rubric">34. The following Preface is said
in Masses of Advent from 17 December to 24 December and in other Masses that
are celebrated in Advent and have no proper Preface. </p>

<p class="calibre6">The Lord be with you.</p>

<p class="response">And with your spirit.</p>

<p class="calibre6">Lift up your hearts.</p>

<p class="response">We lift them up to the Lord.</p>

<p class="calibre6">Let us give thanks to the Lord our God.</p>

<p class="response">It is right and just.</p>

<p class="calibre6">It is truly right and just, our duty and our
salvation, always and everywhere to give you thanks, Lord, holy Father,
almighty and eternal God, through Christ our Lord. </p>

<p class="calibre6">For all the oracles of the prophets foretold
him, the Virgin Mother longed for him with love beyond all telling, John the
Baptist sang of his coming and proclaimed his presence when he came. </p>

<p class="calibre6">It is by his gift that already we rejoice at
the mystery of his Nativity, so that he may find us watchful in prayer and
exultant in his praise. </p>

<p class="calibre6">And so, with Angels and Archangels, with
Thrones and Dominions, and with all the hosts and Powers of heaven, we sing the
hymn of your glory, as without end we acclaim: </p>

<p class="all">Holy, Holy, Holy Lord God of hosts.
Heaven and earth are full of your glory. Hosanna in the highest. Blessed is he
who comes in the name of the Lord. Hosanna in the highest.</p>
