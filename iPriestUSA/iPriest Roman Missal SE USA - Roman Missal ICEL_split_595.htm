<p class="rubric">For convenience, the individual
Commons each offer several Masses with all the elements, namely antiphons and
prayers, included.</p>

<p class="rubric">It is permitted for the Priest,
as appropriate, to exchange antiphons and prayers of the same Common, choosing
those texts which seem more suitable for pastoral reasons.</p>

<p class="rubric">In addition, for Masses of
Memorials, the Prayers over the Offerings and the Prayers after Communion may
also be taken from the weekdays of the current liturgical time as well as from
these Commons.</p>

<p class="rubric">In the Common of Martyrs and in
the Common of Holy Men and Women, all the prayers that are given for men may
also be used for women, with the necessary change of gender.</p>

<p class="rubric">In the individual Commons, texts
in the singular may always be used for several Saints, with the necessary
change to the plural. Similarly, texts in the plural may be used for an
individual, with the necessary change to the singular.</p>

<p class="rubric">Masses that are designated for
specific times or circumstances should only be used for these.</p>
