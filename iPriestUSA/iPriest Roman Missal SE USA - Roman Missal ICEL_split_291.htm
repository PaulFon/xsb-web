EUCHARIST </h2>

<h3 class="calibre2">The Sacrifice and the Sacrament of Christ</h3>

<p class="rubric">60. The following Preface is
said in the Mass of the Lord’s Supper. It may also be said on the Solemnity of the Most Holy Body and Blood of Christ and in Votive Masses of the Most Holy
Eucharist. </p>

<p class="calibre6">The Lord be with you.</p>

<p class="response">And with your spirit.</p>

<p class="calibre6">Lift up your hearts.</p>

<p class="response">We lift them up to the Lord.</p>

<p class="calibre6">Let us give thanks to the Lord our God.</p>

<p class="response">It is right and just.</p>

<p class="calibre6">It is truly right and just, our duty and our
salvation, always and everywhere to give you thanks, Lord, holy Father,
almighty and eternal God, through Christ our Lord. </p>

<p class="calibre6">For he is the true and eternal Priest, who
instituted the pattern of an everlasting sacrifice and was the first to offer
himself as the saving Victim, commanding us to make this offering as his
memorial. </p>

<p class="calibre6">As we eat his flesh that was sacrificed for
us, we are made strong, and, as we drink his Blood that was poured out for us,
we are washed clean. </p>

<p class="calibre6">And so, with Angels and Archangels, with
Thrones and Dominions, and with all the hosts and Powers of heaven, we sing the
hymn of your glory, as without end we acclaim: </p>

<p class="all">Holy, Holy, Holy Lord God of hosts.
Heaven and earth are full of your glory. Hosanna in the highest. Blessed is he
who comes in the name of the Lord. Hosanna in the highest.</p>
