a Nuptial Mass</h2>

<p class="calibre6">or: <a href="iPriest%20Roman%20Missal%20SE%20USA%20-%20Roman%20Missal%20ICEL_split_761.htm#EP1.M">EP1 (Marriage)</a> | <a href="iPriest%20Roman%20Missal%20SE%20USA%20-%20Roman%20Missal%20ICEL_split_762.htm#EP2.M">EP2 (Marriage)</a></p>

<p class="rubric"><img border="0" id="_x0000_i1031" src="pc.gif" class="calibre12"/>108.
The Priest, with hands extended, says: </p>

<p class="calibre6">You are indeed Holy, O Lord, <br class="wordsection"/>
and all you have created rightly gives you praise, <br class="wordsection"/>
for through your Son our Lord Jesus Christ, <br class="wordsection"/>
by the power and working of the Holy Spirit, <br class="wordsection"/>
you give life to all things and make them holy, <br class="wordsection"/>
and you never cease to gather a people to yourself, <br class="wordsection"/>
so that from the rising of the sun to its setting <br class="wordsection"/>
a pure sacrifice may be offered to your name. </p>

<p class="rubric"><img border="0" id="_x0000_i1030" src="cc.gif" class="calibre12"/>109.
He joins his hands and, holding them extended over the offerings, says: </p>

<p class="calibre6">Therefore, O Lord, we humbly implore you: <br class="wordsection"/>
by the same Spirit graciously make holy these gifts <br class="wordsection"/>
we have brought to you for consecration, </p>

<p class="rubric">He joins his hands and makes the
Sign of the Cross once over the bread and chalice together, saying: </p>

<p class="calibre6">that they may become <br class="wordsection"/>
the Body and <span class="red1">+</span> Blood of your Son our Lord Jesus Christ, </p>

<p class="rubric">He joins his hands. </p>

<p class="calibre6">at whose command we celebrate these
mysteries. </p>

<p class="rubric">110. In the formulas that
follow, the words of the Lord should be pronounced clearly and distinctly, as
the nature of these words requires. </p>

<p class="calibre6">For on the night he was betrayed </p>

<p class="rubric">He takes the bread and, holding
it slightly raised above the altar, continues: </p>

<p class="calibre6">he himself took bread, and, giving you
thanks, <br class="wordsection"/>
he said the blessing, <br class="wordsection"/>
broke the bread and gave it to his disciples, saying: </p>

<p class="rubric">He bows slightly. </p>

<p class="calibre6">TAKE THIS, ALL OF YOU, AND EAT OF IT, <br class="wordsection"/>
FOR THIS IS MY BODY, WHICH WILL BE GIVEN UP FOR YOU.</p>

<p class="rubric">He shows the consecrated host to
the people, places it again on the paten, and genuflects in adoration. </p>

<p class="rubric">111. After this, he continues: </p>

<p class="calibre6">In a similar way, when supper was ended, </p>

<p class="rubric">He takes the chalice and,
holding it slightly raised above the altar, continues: </p>

<p class="calibre6">he took the chalice, and, giving you thanks, <br class="wordsection"/>
he said the blessing, and gave the chalice to his disciples, saying: </p>

<p class="rubric">He bows slightly. </p>

<p class="calibre6">TAKE THIS, ALL OF YOU, AND DRINK FROM IT, <br class="wordsection"/>
FOR THIS IS THE CHALICE OF MY BLOOD, <br class="wordsection"/>
THE BLOOD OF THE NEW AND ETERNAL COVENANT, <br class="wordsection"/>
WHICH WILL BE POURED OUT FOR YOU <br class="wordsection"/>
AND FOR MANY FOR THE FORGIVENESS OF SINS. </p>

<p class="calibre6">DO THIS IN MEMORY OF ME. </p>

<p class="rubric">He shows the chalice to the
people, places it on the corporal, and genuflects in adoration. </p>

<p class="rubric"><img border="0" id="_x0000_i1029" src="pc.gif" class="calibre12"/>112.
Then he says: </p>

<p class="calibre6">The mystery of faith. </p>

<p class="rubric">And the people continue,
acclaiming: </p>

<p class="response">We proclaim your Death, O
Lord, <br class="wordsection"/>
and profess your Resurrection until you come again. </p>

<p class="rubric">or: </p>

<p class="response">When we eat this Bread and
drink this Cup, <br class="wordsection"/>
we proclaim your Death, O Lord, until you come again. </p>

<p class="rubric">or: </p>

<p class="response">Save us, Saviour of the world,
<br class="wordsection"/>
for by your Cross and Resurrection you have set us free. </p>

<p class="rubric"><img border="0" id="_x0000_i1028" src="cc.gif" class="calibre12"/>113.
Then the Priest, with hands extended, says: </p>

<p class="calibre6">Therefore, O Lord, as we celebrate the
memorial of the saving Passion of your Son, <br class="wordsection"/>
his wondrous Resurrection and Ascension into heaven, <br class="wordsection"/>
and as we look forward to his second coming, <br class="wordsection"/>
we offer you in thanksgiving this holy and living sacrifice. </p>

<p class="calibre6">Look, we pray, upon the oblation of your
Church and, <br class="wordsection"/>
recognizing the sacrificial Victim <br class="wordsection"/>
by whose death you willed to reconcile us to yourself, <br class="wordsection"/>
grant that we, who are nourished by the Body and Blood of your Son <br class="wordsection"/>
and filled with his Holy Spirit, <br class="wordsection"/>
may become one body, one spirit in Christ. </p>

<p class="rubric">[Celebrant or one concelebrant]</p>

<p class="calibre6">May he make of us an eternal offering to you,
<br class="wordsection"/>
so that we may obtain an inheritance with your elect, <br class="wordsection"/>
especially with the most Blessed Virgin Mary, Mother of God, with blessed Joseph,
her Spouse, <br class="wordsection"/>
with your blessed Apostles and glorious Martyrs <br class="wordsection"/>
<span class="red1">(</span>with Saint <span class="red1">N. - the Saint of the day or Patron Saint)</span><br class="wordsection"/>
and with all the Saints, <br class="wordsection"/>
on whose constant intercession in your presence <br class="wordsection"/>
we rely for unfailing help. </p>

<p class="rubric">[Celebrant or one concelebrant]</p>

<p class="calibre6">May this Sacrifice of our reconciliation, we
pray, O Lord,<br class="wordsection"/>
advance the peace and salvation of all the world. <br class="wordsection"/>
Be pleased to confirm in faith and charity <br class="wordsection"/>
your pilgrim Church on earth, <br class="wordsection"/>
with your servant <span class="red1">Francis</span> our Pope and <span class="red1">N.</span> our
Bishop, <br class="wordsection"/>
the Order of Bishops, all the clergy, <br class="wordsection"/>
and the entire people you have gained for your own. </p>

<p class="calibre6">Listen graciously to the prayers of this
family, <br class="wordsection"/>
whom you have summoned before you. </p>

<p class="calibre6">Strengthen, we pray, in the grace of Marriage
<span class="red1">[Groom]</span> and <span class="red1">[Bride]</span>, <br class="wordsection"/>
whom you have brought happily to their wedding day, <br class="wordsection"/>
that under your protection<br class="wordsection"/>
they may always be faithful in their lives<br class="wordsection"/>
to the covenant they have sealed in your presence. </p>

<p class="calibre6">In your compassion, O merciful Father,<br class="wordsection"/>
gather to yourself all your children<br class="wordsection"/>
scattered throughout the earth.</p>

<p class="calibre6">To our departed brothers and sisters <br class="wordsection"/>
and to all who were pleasing to you at their passing from this life, give kind
admittance to your kingdom. <br class="wordsection"/>
There we hope to enjoy for ever the fullness of your glory </p>

<p class="rubric">He joins his hands. </p>

<p class="calibre6">through Christ our Lord, <br class="wordsection"/>
through whom you bestow on the world all that is good. </p>

<p class="rubric"><img border="0" id="_x0000_i1027" src="pcc.gif" class="calibre12"/>114.
He takes the chalice and the paten with the host and, raising both, he says: </p>

<p class="calibre6">Through him, and with him, and in him, <br class="wordsection"/>
O God, almighty Father, <br class="wordsection"/>
in the unity of the Holy Spirit, <br class="wordsection"/>
all glory and honour is yours, <br class="wordsection"/>
for ever and ever.</p>

<p class="rubric">The people acclaim: </p>

<p class="response">Amen. </p>

<h3 class="calibre2"><a class="calibre3" id="NB"></a>Nuptial Blessing<a class="calibre3" id="MNB1"></a> or <a href="iPriest%20Roman%20Missal%20SE%20USA%20-%20Roman%20Missal%20ICEL_split_764.htm#MNB2" class="calibre3"><span class="calibre20">Option 2</span></a> or <a href="iPriest%20Roman%20Missal%20SE%20USA%20-%20Roman%20Missal%20ICEL_split_765.htm#MNB3" class="calibre3"><span class="calibre20">Option 3</span></a></h3>

<p class="rubric">124. After the chalice and paten
have been set down, the Priest, with hands joined, says: </p>

<p class="calibre6">At the Saviour’s command <br class="wordsection"/>
and formed by divine teaching, we dare to say: </p>

<p class="rubric">He extends his hands and,
together with the people, continues: </p>

<p class="all">Our Father, who art in heaven, <br class="wordsection"/>
hallowed be thy name; <br class="wordsection"/>
thy kingdom come, <br class="wordsection"/>
thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven. <br class="wordsection"/>
Give us this day our daily bread, <br class="wordsection"/>
and forgive us our trespasses, <br class="wordsection"/>
as we forgive those who trespass against us; <br class="wordsection"/>
and lead us not into temptation, <br class="wordsection"/>
but deliver us from evil. </p>

<p class="rubric">After the Our Father, the prayer
“Deliver us” is omitted. The Priest, standing and facing the bride and
bridegroom, invokes on them God’s blessing, which is never omitted.</p>

<p class="rubric">In the invitation, if one or
both of the spouses will not be receiving Communion, the words in parentheses
are omitted. In the prayer, the words in parentheses may be omitted if it seems
that circumstances suggest it, for example, if the bride and bridegroom are
advanced in years.</p>

<p class="rubric">The bride and bridegroom
approach the altar or, if appropriate, they remain at their place and kneel.</p>

<p class="rubric">The Priest, with hands joined,
calls upon those present to pray, saying: </p>

<p class="calibre6">Dear brothers and sisters,<br class="wordsection"/>
let us humbly pray to the Lord<br class="wordsection"/>
that on these his servants, now married in Christ,<br class="wordsection"/>
he may mercifully pour out<br class="wordsection"/>
the blessing of his grace<br class="wordsection"/>
and make of one heart in love<br class="wordsection"/>
(by the Sacrament of Christ’s Body and Blood)<br class="wordsection"/>
those he has joined by a holy covenant.</p>

<p class="rubric">And all pray in silence for a
while.</p>

<p class="rubric">Then the Priest, with hands
extended over the bride and bridegroom, continues: </p>

<p class="calibre6">God, who by your mighty power <br class="wordsection"/>
created all things out of nothing, <br class="wordsection"/>
and when you had set in place <br class="wordsection"/>
the beginnings of the universe, <br class="wordsection"/>
formed man and woman in your own image,<br class="wordsection"/>
making the woman<br class="wordsection"/>
an inseparable helpmate to the man,<br class="wordsection"/>
that they might no longer be two, but one flesh,<br class="wordsection"/>
and you taught that<br class="wordsection"/>
what you were pleased to make one must never be divided;</p>

<p class="calibre6">God, who consecrated the bond of Marriage by
so great a mystery<br class="wordsection"/>
that in the wedding covenant <br class="wordsection"/>
you foreshadowed the Sacrament of Christ and his Church;</p>

<p class="calibre6">God, by whom woman is joined to man <br class="wordsection"/>
and the companionship they had in the beginning <br class="wordsection"/>
is endowed with the one blessing<br class="wordsection"/>
not forfeited by original sin<br class="wordsection"/>
nor washed away by the flood.</p>

<p class="calibre6">Look now with favour on these your servants,<br class="wordsection"/>
joined together in Marriage,<br class="wordsection"/>
who ask to be strengthened by your blessing.</p>

<p class="calibre6">Send down on them the grace of the Holy
Spirit, <br class="wordsection"/>
and pour your love into their hearts<br class="wordsection"/>
that they may remain faithful in the Marriage covenant.</p>

<p class="calibre6">May the grace of love and peace<br class="wordsection"/>
abide in your daughter <span class="red1">[Bride]</span>,<br class="wordsection"/>
and let her always follow the example of those holy women <br class="wordsection"/>
whose praises are sung in the Scriptures.</p>

<p class="calibre6">May her husband <span class="red1">[Groom]</span>
entrust his heart to her, <br class="wordsection"/>
so that, acknowledging her as his equal <br class="wordsection"/>
and his joint heir to the life of grace,<br class="wordsection"/>
he may show her due honour<br class="wordsection"/>
and cherish her always<br class="wordsection"/>
with the love that Christ has for his Church.</p>

<p class="calibre6">And now, Lord, we implore you:<br class="wordsection"/>
may these your servants<br class="wordsection"/>
hold fast to the faith <br class="wordsection"/>
and keep your commandments; <br class="wordsection"/>
made one in the flesh,<br class="wordsection"/>
may they be blameless in all they do;<br class="wordsection"/>
and with the strength that comes from the Gospel, <br class="wordsection"/>
may they bear true witness to Christ before all; <br class="wordsection"/>
(may they be blessed with children, <br class="wordsection"/>
and prove themselves virtuous parents,<br class="wordsection"/>
who live to see their children’s children).</p>

<p class="calibre6">And grant that,<br class="wordsection"/>
reaching at last the fullness of years together for which they hope,<br class="wordsection"/>
they may come to the life of the blessed in the Kingdom of heaven.</p>

<p class="calibre6">Through Christ our Lord.</p>

<p class="response">Amen.</p>

<p class="rubric">The prayer Lord Jesus Christ is
omitted, and The peace of the Lord is said immediately.</p>

<p class="rubric">127. The Priest, turned towards
the people, extending and then joining his hands, adds: </p>

<p class="calibre6">The peace of the Lord be with you always. </p>

<p class="rubric">The people reply: </p>

<p class="response">And with your spirit. </p>

<p class="rubric">128. Then, if appropriate, the
Deacon, or the Priest, adds: </p>

<p class="calibre6">Let us offer each other the sign of peace. </p>

<p class="rubric">Then the bride and bridegroom
and all present offer one another a sign, in keeping with local customs, that
expresses peace, communion and charity.</p>

<p class="calibre6"><a href="iPriest%20Roman%20Missal%20SE%20USA%20-%20Roman%20Missal%20ICEL_split_347.htm#CR2">The Communion Rite then continues.</a></p>

<p class="anth">Communion Antiphon | Cf. Eph 5:25, 27</p>

<p class="ant">Christ loved the Church and handed
himself over for her, to present her as a holy and spotless bride for himself
(alleluia).</p>

<h3 class="calibre2">Prayer after Communion</h3>

<p class="calibre6">By the power of this sacrifice, O Lord,<br class="wordsection"/>
accompany with your loving favour<br class="wordsection"/>
what in your providence you have instituted,<br class="wordsection"/>
so as to make of one heart in love<br class="wordsection"/>
those you have already joined in this holy union<br class="wordsection"/>
(and replenished with the one Bread and the one Chalice). </p>

<p class="calibre6">Through Christ our Lord.</p>

<h3 class="calibre2">Solemn Blessing at the End of Mass</h3>

<p class="rubric">The Priest, with hands extended
over the bride and bridegroom, says: </p>

<p class="calibre6">May God the eternal Father<br class="wordsection"/>
keep you of one heart in love for one another,<br class="wordsection"/>
that the peace of Christ may dwell in you<br class="wordsection"/>
and abide always in your home.</p>

<p class="response">Amen.</p>

<p class="calibre6">May you be blessed in your children, <br class="wordsection"/>
have solace in your friends<br class="wordsection"/>
and enjoy true peace with everyone. </p>

<p class="response">Amen.</p>

<p class="calibre6">May you be witnesses in the world to God’s
charity,<br class="wordsection"/>
so that the afflicted and needy who have known your kindness <br class="wordsection"/>
may one day receive you thankfully<br class="wordsection"/>
into the eternal dwelling of God.</p>

<p class="response">Amen.</p>

<p class="rubric">And he blesses all the people,
adding:</p>

<p class="calibre6">And may almighty God bless all of you who are
gathered here: <br class="wordsection"/>
the Father, and the Son, <span class="red1">+</span> and the Holy Spirit.</p>

<p class="response">Amen.</p>
