<h3 class="calibre2">Christ the light of the nations</h3>

<p class="rubric">38. The following Preface is
said in Masses of the Solemnity of the Epiphany. This Preface, or one of the
Prefaces of the Nativity, may be said even on days after the Epiphany up to the
Saturday that precedes the Feast of the Baptism of the Lord. </p>

<p class="calibre6">The Lord be with you.</p>

<p class="response">And with your spirit.</p>

<p class="calibre6">Lift up your hearts.</p>

<p class="response">We lift them up to the Lord.</p>

<p class="calibre6">Let us give thanks to the Lord our God.</p>

<p class="response">It is right and just.</p>

<p class="calibre6">It is truly right and just, our duty and our
salvation, always and everywhere to give you thanks, Lord, holy Father,
almighty and eternal God. </p>

<p class="calibre6">For today you have revealed the mystery of our salvation in Christ as a light for the nations, and when he appeared in our
mortal nature, you made us new by the glory of his immortal nature. </p>

<p class="calibre6">And so, with Angels and Archangels, with
Thrones and Dominions, and with all the hosts and Powers of heaven, we sing the
hymn of your glory, as without end we acclaim: </p>

<p class="all">Holy, Holy, Holy Lord God of hosts.
Heaven and earth are full of your glory. Hosanna in the highest. Blessed is he
who comes in the name of the Lord. Hosanna in the highest.</p>
