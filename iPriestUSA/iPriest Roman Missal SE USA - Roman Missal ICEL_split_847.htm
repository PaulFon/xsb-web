RITE OF BLESSING A CHALICE AND A PATEN<br class="calibre4"/>
WITHIN MASS</h2>

<p class="rubric">1. Since the chalice and paten
are used for the offering and consecration of the bread and wine and for
communion, they are designated exclusively and permanently for the celebration
of the Eucharist, and so become “sacred vessels.”<br class="wordsection"/>
2. The intention of designating these vessels exclusively for the celebration
of the Eucharist is made manifest before the community of the faithful by a
special blessing which it is appropriate to impart during Mass.<br class="wordsection"/>
3. Any Priest may bless a chalice and paten, provided these vessels have been
made according to the norms indicated above in the General Instruction of the
Roman Missal, nos. 327-332.<br class="wordsection"/>
4. If only a chalice or only a paten is to be blessed, the texts should be
suitably adapted.<br class="wordsection"/>
5. After the reading of the word of God, a homily is given in which the Priest
explains both the biblical readings and the meaning of the blessing of a
chalice and paten that are used in the celebration of the Lord’s Supper.<br class="wordsection"/>
6. When the Universal Prayer is concluded, the ministers, or representatives of
the community presenting the chalice and paten, place these latter on the
altar. Then the Priest moves to the altar, while there is sung this antiphon:</p>

<p class="calibre6">I will take up the chalice of salvation,<br class="wordsection"/>
and call upon the name of the Lord.</p>

<p class="rubric">Another appropriate chant may
also be sung.<br class="wordsection"/>
7. When the singing is over, the Priest says:</p>

<p class="calibre6">Let us pray.</p>

<p class="rubric">And all pray in silence for a
moment. Then the Priest continues: </p>

<p class="calibre6">With joy, Lord God,<br class="wordsection"/>
we place on your altar this chalice and paten<br class="wordsection"/>
for the celebration of the sacrifice of the new covenant: <br class="wordsection"/>
may the Body and Blood of your Son,<br class="wordsection"/>
offered and received by means of these vessels,<br class="wordsection"/>
make them holy.</p>

<p class="calibre6">Grant, we pray, O Lord,<br class="wordsection"/>
that, celebrating the unblemished sacrifice,<br class="wordsection"/>
we may be renewed by your Sacraments on earth <br class="wordsection"/>
and endowed with your Spirit,<br class="wordsection"/>
until with the Saints we come to delight in your banquet <br class="wordsection"/>
in the Kingdom of Heaven.</p>

<p class="calibre6">Glory and honour to you for ever.</p>

<p class="rubric">All reply:</p>

<p class="response">Blessed be God for ever.</p>

<p class="rubric">8. The ministers then place the
corporal on the altar. Some of the faithful carry forward bread, wine, and
water for the celebration of the Lord’s Sacrifice. The Priest puts the
offerings on the newly blessed paten and in the newly blessed chalice and
offers them in the usual way. Meanwhile, if appropriate, this antiphon with
Psalm 115 is sung:</p>

<p class="anth">Antiphon</p>

<p class="calibre6">The cup of salvation I will raise;<br class="wordsection"/>
I will call on the name of the LORD.</p>

<p class="anth">Psalm 115</p>

<p class="calibre6">I trusted, even when I said, “I am sorely
afflicted,”<br class="wordsection"/>
and when I said in my alarm, “These people are all liars.” </p>

<p class="rubric">(The antiphon is repeated)</p>

<p class="calibre6">How can I repay the Lord for all his goodness
to me?<br class="wordsection"/>
The cup of salvation I will raise;<br class="wordsection"/>
I will call on the name of the LORD.</p>

<p class="rubric">(The antiphon is repeated)</p>

<p class="calibre6">My vows to the LORD I will fulfil<br class="wordsection"/>
before all his people.<br class="wordsection"/>
How precious in the eyes of the LORD<br class="wordsection"/>
is the death of his faithful. </p>

<p class="rubric">(The antiphon is repeated)</p>
