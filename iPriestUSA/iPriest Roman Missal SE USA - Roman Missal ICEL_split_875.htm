<p class="girm">16. The celebration of Mass, as the action of Christ and of the
People of God arrayed hierarchically, is the centre of the whole of Christian
life for the Church both universal and local, as well as for each of the
faithful individually.<a href="iPriest%20Roman%20Missal%20SE%20USA%20-%20Roman%20Missal%20ICEL_split_884.htm#fn-22"> [22]</a><a id="fn-22-bl"></a> For in it
is found the high point both of the action by which God sanctifies the world in
Christ and of the worship that the human race offers to the Father, adoring him
through Christ, the Son of God, in the Holy Spirit.<a href="iPriest%20Roman%20Missal%20SE%20USA%20-%20Roman%20Missal%20ICEL_split_884.htm#fn-23"> [23]</a><a id="fn-23-bl"></a> In it, moreover, during the course of the year, the
mysteries of redemption are celebrated so as to be in some way made present.<a href="iPriest%20Roman%20Missal%20SE%20USA%20-%20Roman%20Missal%20ICEL_split_884.htm#fn-24"> [24]</a><a id="fn-24-bl"></a> As to the other sacred actions and
all the activities of the Christian life, these are bound up with it, flow from
it, and are ordered to it.<a href="iPriest%20Roman%20Missal%20SE%20USA%20-%20Roman%20Missal%20ICEL_split_884.htm#fn-25"> [25]</a><a id="fn-25-bl"></a></p>

<p class="girm">17. It is, therefore, of the greatest importance that the
celebration of the Mass or the Lord’s Supper be so ordered that the sacred
ministers and the faithful taking part in it, according to the state proper to
each, may draw from it more abundantly<a href="iPriest%20Roman%20Missal%20SE%20USA%20-%20Roman%20Missal%20ICEL_split_884.htm#fn-26"> [26]</a><a id="fn-26-bl"></a> those fruits, to obtain which, Christ the Lord instituted
the Eucharistic Sacrifice of his Body and Blood and entrusted it as the
memorial of his Passion and Resurrection to the Church, his beloved Bride.<a href="iPriest%20Roman%20Missal%20SE%20USA%20-%20Roman%20Missal%20ICEL_split_884.htm#fn-27"> [27]</a><a id="fn-27-bl"></a></p>

<p class="girm">18. This will fittingly come about if, with due regard for the
nature and other circumstances of each liturgical assembly, the entire
celebration is arranged in such a way that it leads to a conscious, active, and
full participation of the faithful, namely in body and in mind, a participation
fervent with faith, hope, and charity, of the sort which is desired by the
Church and which is required by the very nature of the celebration and to which
the Christian people have a right and duty in virtue of their Baptism.<a href="iPriest%20Roman%20Missal%20SE%20USA%20-%20Roman%20Missal%20ICEL_split_884.htm#fn-28"> [28]</a><a id="fn-28-bl"></a></p>

<p class="girm">19. Even though it is on occasion not possible to have the
presence and active participation of the faithful, which manifest more clearly
the ecclesial nature of the celebration,<a href="iPriest%20Roman%20Missal%20SE%20USA%20-%20Roman%20Missal%20ICEL_split_884.htm#fn-29"> [29]</a><a id="fn-29-bl"></a> the celebration of the Eucharist is always endowed with its
own efficacy and dignity, since it is the act of Christ and of the Church, in
which the Priest fulfils his own principal function and always acts for the sake
of the people’s salvation.</p>

<p class="girm">Hence the Priest is recommended to celebrate the Eucharistic
Sacrifice, in so far as he can, even daily.<a href="iPriest%20Roman%20Missal%20SE%20USA%20-%20Roman%20Missal%20ICEL_split_884.htm#fn-30"> [30]</a><a id="fn-30-bl"></a></p>

<p class="girm">20. Since, however, the celebration of the Eucharist, like the
entire Liturgy, is carried out by means of perceptible signs by which the faith
is nourished, strengthened, and expressed,<a href="iPriest%20Roman%20Missal%20SE%20USA%20-%20Roman%20Missal%20ICEL_split_884.htm#fn-31"> [31]</a><a id="fn-31-bl"></a> the greatest care is to be taken that those forms and
elements proposed by the Church are chosen and arranged, which, given the
circumstances of persons and places, more effectively foster active and full
participation and more aptly respond to the spiritual needs of the faithful.</p>

<p class="girm">21. Hence this Instruction aims both to offer general lines for a
suitable ordering of the celebration of the Eucharist and to explain the rules
by which individual forms of celebration may be arranged.<a href="iPriest%20Roman%20Missal%20SE%20USA%20-%20Roman%20Missal%20ICEL_split_884.htm#fn-32"> [32]</a><a id="fn-32-bl"></a></p>

<p class="girm">22. The celebration of the Eucharist in a particular Church is of
the utmost importance.</p>

<p class="girm">For the Diocesan Bishop, the prime steward of the mysteries of
God in the particular Church entrusted to his care, is the moderator, promoter,
and guardian of the whole of liturgical life.<a href="iPriest%20Roman%20Missal%20SE%20USA%20-%20Roman%20Missal%20ICEL_split_884.htm#fn-33"> [33]</a><a id="fn-33-bl"></a> In celebrations that take place with the Bishop presiding,
and especially in the celebration of the Eucharist by the Bishop himself with
the Presbyterate, the Deacons, and the people taking part, the mystery of the
Church is manifest. Hence, solemn celebrations of Mass of this sort must be
exemplary for the entire diocese.</p>

<p class="girm">The Bishop should therefore be determined that the Priests, the
Deacons, and the lay Christian faithful grasp ever more deeply the genuine
significance of the rites and liturgical texts, and thereby be led to the
active and fruitful celebration of the Eucharist. To that end, he should also
be vigilant in ensuring that the dignity of these celebrations be enhanced and,
in promoting such dignity, the beauty of the sacred place, of the music, and of
art should contribute as greatly as possible.</p>

<p class="girm">23. Moreover, in order that such a celebration may correspond
more fully to the prescriptions and spirit of the Sacred Liturgy, and also in
order that its pastoral effectiveness be enhanced, certain accommodations and
adaptations are set out in this General Instruction and in the Order of Mass.</p>

<p class="girm">24. These adaptations consist, for the most part, in the choice
of certain rites or texts, that is, of the chants, readings, prayers,
explanatory interventions, and gestures capable of responding better to the
needs, the preparation, and the culture of the participants and which are
entrusted to the Priest Celebrant. However, the Priest will remember that he is
the servant of the Sacred Liturgy and that he himself is not permitted, on his
own initiative, to add, to remove, or to change anything in the celebration of
Mass.<a href="iPriest%20Roman%20Missal%20SE%20USA%20-%20Roman%20Missal%20ICEL_split_884.htm#fn-34"> [34]</a><a id="fn-34-bl"></a></p>

<p class="girm">25. In addition, at the proper place in the Missal are indicated
certain adaptations which in accordance with the Constitution on the Sacred
Liturgy pertain respectively to the Diocesan Bishop or to the Conference of
Bishops<a href="iPriest%20Roman%20Missal%20SE%20USA%20-%20Roman%20Missal%20ICEL_split_884.htm#fn-35"> [35]</a><a id="fn-35-bl"></a> (cf. below nos. 387,
388-393).</p>

<p class="girm">26. As for variations and the more profound adaptations which
give consideration to the traditions and culture of peoples and regions, to be
introduced in accordance with article 40 of the Constitution on the Sacred
Liturgy, for reasons of usefulness or necessity, those norms set out in the
Instruction on the Roman Liturgy and Inculturation<a href="iPriest%20Roman%20Missal%20SE%20USA%20-%20Roman%20Missal%20ICEL_split_884.htm#fn-36"> [36]</a><a id="fn-36-bl"></a> and below in nos. 395-399 are to be observed.</p>
