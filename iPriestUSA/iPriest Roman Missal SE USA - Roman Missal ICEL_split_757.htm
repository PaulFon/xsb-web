<p class="calibre6">Let us pray.</p>

<p class="rubric">And all pray in silence with the
Priest for a while.</p>

<p class="calibre6">O God, who have taught the ministers of your
Church <br class="wordsection"/>
to seek not to be served<br class="wordsection"/>
but to serve their brothers and sisters,<br class="wordsection"/>
grant, we pray, that this your servant,<br class="wordsection"/>
whom you graciously choose today<br class="wordsection"/>
for the office of Deacon,<br class="wordsection"/>
may be effective in action, gentle in ministry,<br class="wordsection"/>
and constant in prayer.</p>

<h3 class="calibre2">Prayer over the Offerings </h3>

<p class="calibre6">Holy Father, whose Son chose to wash the
disciples’ feet<br class="wordsection"/>
and so set us an example,<br class="wordsection"/>
accept, we pray, the gifts of our service,<br class="wordsection"/>
and grant that,<br class="wordsection"/>
offering ourselves as a spiritual sacrifice,<br class="wordsection"/>
we may be filled with a spirit of humility and zeal.<br class="wordsection"/>
Through Christ our Lord.</p>

<h3 class="calibre2">Preface: Christ, source of all ministry in the Church.</h3>

<p class="calibre6">The Lord be with you.</p>

<p class="response">And with your spirit.</p>

<p class="calibre6">Lift up your hearts.</p>

<p class="response">We lift them up to the Lord.</p>

<p class="calibre6">Let us give thanks to the Lord our God.</p>

<p class="response">It is right and just.</p>

<p class="calibre6">It is truly right and just, our duty and our
salvation, <br class="wordsection"/>
always and everywhere to give you thanks,<br class="wordsection"/>
Lord, holy Father, almighty and eternal God.</p>

<p class="calibre6">For by the anointing of the Holy Spirit<br class="wordsection"/>
you constituted your Only Begotten Son<br class="wordsection"/>
High Priest of the new and eternal covenant,<br class="wordsection"/>
and by your wondrous plan were pleased to decree<br class="wordsection"/>
that his one Priesthood should continue in the Church.</p>

<p class="calibre6">For Christ not only adorns with a royal
priesthood <br class="wordsection"/>
the people he has made his own,<br class="wordsection"/>
but with a brother’s goodness <br class="wordsection"/>
he also chooses men to become sharers in his sacred ministry<br class="wordsection"/>
through the laying on of hands.</p>

<p class="calibre6">He chooses them to lead your holy people in
charity, <br class="wordsection"/>
to nourish them with your word,<br class="wordsection"/>
and to strengthen them with the Sacraments.</p>

<p class="calibre6">As they give up their lives for you<br class="wordsection"/>
and for the salvation of their brothers and sisters,<br class="wordsection"/>
they strive to be conformed to the image of Christ himself, <br class="wordsection"/>
and offer you a constant witness of faith and love.</p>

<p class="calibre6">And so, Lord, with all the Angels and Saints,<br class="wordsection"/>
we, too, give you thanks as in exultation we acclaim:</p>

<p class="all">Holy, Holy, Holy Lord God of hosts.
Heaven and earth are full of your glory. Hosanna in the highest. Blessed is he
who comes in the name of the Lord. Hosanna in the highest.</p>

whom you have been pleased to raise to the Order of the Diaconate;<br class="wordsection"/>
in your mercy, we pray, keep safe your gifts in them,<br class="wordsection"/>

these your servants,<br class="wordsection"/>
whom today you have been pleased to choose<br class="wordsection"/>
for the diaconal service of your people,<br class="wordsection"/>
and all the clergy.</p>

<p class="calibre6">Be mindful also of those who take part in
this offering, <br class="wordsection"/>
those gathered here before you,<br class="wordsection"/>
your entire people,<br class="wordsection"/>
and all who seek you with a sincere heart.</p>

<p class="calibre6">Remember also<br class="wordsection"/>

<p class="calibre6">Grant, O Lord, to your servant, <br class="wordsection"/>
whom you have replenished <br class="wordsection"/>
with heavenly food and drink, <br class="wordsection"/>
that, for the sake of your glory <br class="wordsection"/>
and the salvation of believers, <br class="wordsection"/>
