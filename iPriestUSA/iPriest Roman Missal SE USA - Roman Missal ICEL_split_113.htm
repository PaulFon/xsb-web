<p class="rubric">On the afternoon of this day,
about three o’clock (unless a later hour is chosen for a pastoral reason),
there takes place the celebration of the Lord’s Passion consisting of three
parts, namely, the Liturgy of the Word, the Adoration of the Cross, and Holy
Communion.</p>

<p class="rubric">In the United States, if the
size or nature of a parish or other community indicates the pastoral need for
an additional liturgical service, the Diocesan Bishop may permit the service to
be repeated later. This liturgy by its very nature may not, however, be
celebrated in the absence of a Priest.<br class="wordsection"/>
The Priest and the Deacon, if a Deacon is present, wearing red vestments as for
Mass, go to the altar in silence and, after making a reverence to the altar,
prostrate themselves or, if appropriate, kneel and pray in silence for a while.
All others kneel.</p>

<p class="rubric">Then the Priest, with the
ministers, goes to the chair where, facing the people, who are standing, he
says, with hands extended, one of the following prayers, omitting the
invitation Let us pray.</p>

<h3 class="calibre2">Prayer</h3>

<p class="calibre6">Remember your mercies, O Lord,<br class="wordsection"/>
and with your eternal protection sanctify your servants, <br class="wordsection"/>
for whom Christ your Son,<br class="wordsection"/>
by the shedding of his Blood,<br class="wordsection"/>
established the Paschal Mystery.<br class="wordsection"/>
Who lives and reigns for ever and ever.</p>

<p class="rubric">Or:</p>

<p class="calibre6">O God, who by the Passion of Christ your Son,
our Lord, <br class="wordsection"/>
abolished the death inherited from ancient sin<br class="wordsection"/>
by every succeeding generation,<br class="wordsection"/>
grant that just as, being conformed to him, <br class="wordsection"/>
we have borne by the law of nature<br class="wordsection"/>
the image of the man of earth,<br class="wordsection"/>
so by the sanctification of grace<br class="wordsection"/>
we may bear the image of the Man of heaven. </p>

<p class="calibre6">Through Christ our Lord.</p>

<p class="response">Amen.</p>
