<p class="rubric">And all pray in silence with the Priest for a while.</p>

<p class="calibre6">Almighty ever-living God,<br class="wordsection"/>
who, when Christ had been baptised in the River Jordan<br class="wordsection"/>
and as the Holy Spirit descended upon him, <br class="wordsection"/>
solemnly declared him your beloved Son, <br class="wordsection"/>
grant that your children by adoption, <br class="wordsection"/>
reborn of water and the Holy Spirit,<br class="wordsection"/>
may always be well pleasing to you. </p>

<p class="calibre6">Through our Lord Jesus Christ, your Son, who lives and reigns with you in
the unity of the Holy Spirit, one God, for ever and ever.</p>

<p class="rubric">Or:</p>

<p class="calibre6">O God, whose Only Begotten Son has appeared in our very flesh, grant, we
pray, that we may be inwardly transformed through him whom we recognise as
outwardly like ourselves.</p>

ever and ever.</p>

<h3 class="calibre2">Prayer over the Offerings</h3>

<p class="calibre6">Accept, O Lord, the offerings we have brought to honour the revealing of your beloved Son, so that the oblation of your faithful may be transformed into
the sacrifice of him who willed in his compassion to wash away the sins of the
world.</p>

<h3 class="calibre2">Preface: The Baptism of the Lord.</h3>

<p class="calibre6">The Lord be with you.</p>

<p class="response">And with your spirit.</p>

<p class="calibre6">Lift up your hearts.</p>

<p class="response">We lift them up to the Lord.</p>

<p class="calibre6">Let us give thanks to the Lord our God.</p>

<p class="response">It is right and just.</p>

<p class="calibre6">It is truly right and just, our duty and our salvation, <br class="wordsection"/>
always and everywhere to give you thanks,<br class="wordsection"/>
Lord, holy Father, almighty and eternal God.</p>

<p class="calibre6">For in the waters of the Jordan<br class="wordsection"/>
you revealed with signs and wonders a new Baptism, <br class="wordsection"/>
so that through the voice that came down from heaven<br class="wordsection"/>
we might come to believe in your Word dwelling among us, <br class="wordsection"/>
and by the Spirit’s descending in the likeness of a dove<br class="wordsection"/>
we might know that Christ your Servant<br class="wordsection"/>
has been anointed with the oil of gladness<br class="wordsection"/>
and sent to bring the good news to the poor.</p>

<p class="calibre6">And so, with the Powers of heaven, we worship you constantly on earth, and
before your majesty without end we acclaim:</p>

<p class="all">Holy, Holy, Holy Lord God of hosts. Heaven and earth are full of your glory. Hosanna in the highest. Blessed is he who comes in the name of the
Lord. Hosanna in the highest.</p>
