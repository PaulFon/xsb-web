who in fasting, prayer and almsgiving<br class="wordsection"/>
have shown us a remedy for sin,<br class="wordsection"/>
look graciously on this confession of our lowliness, <br class="wordsection"/>

may always be lifted up by your mercy.</p>

<h3 class="calibre2">Prayer over the Offerings</h3>

<p class="calibre6">The Lord be with you.</p>

<p class="response">And with your spirit.</p>

<p class="calibre6">Lift up your hearts.</p>

always and everywhere to give you thanks,<br class="wordsection"/>
Lord, holy Father, almighty and eternal God, <br class="wordsection"/>
through Christ our Lord.</p>

<p class="calibre6">For when he asked the Samaritan woman for water to drink, <br class="wordsection"/>
he had already created the gift of faith within her<br class="wordsection"/>
and so ardently did he thirst for her faith,<br class="wordsection"/>
that he kindled in her the fire of divine love.</p>

<p class="calibre6">And so we, too, give you thanks<br class="wordsection"/>
and with the Angels<br class="wordsection"/>
praise your mighty deeds, as we acclaim:</p>

<p class="all">Holy, Holy, Holy Lord God of hosts. Heaven and earth are full of your glory. Hosanna in the highest. Blessed is he who comes in the name of the
Lord. Hosanna in the highest.</p>

<p class="ant">For anyone who drinks it, says the Lord, the water I shall give
will become in him a spring welling up to eternal life.</p>

<p class="rubric">When another Gospel is read: | Cf. Ps 84 (83): 4-5</p>

<p class="ant">The sparrow finds a home, and the swallow a nest for her young: by
your altars, O Lord of hosts, my King and my God. Blessed are they who dwell in
your house, for ever singing your praise.</p>

<h3 class="calibre2">Prayer after Communion</h3>

<p class="calibre6">As we receive the pledge<br class="wordsection"/>
of things yet hidden in heaven<br class="wordsection"/>
and are nourished while still on earth<br class="wordsection"/>
with the Bread that comes from on high,<br class="wordsection"/>
we humbly entreat you, O Lord,<br class="wordsection"/>
that what is being brought about in us in mystery <br class="wordsection"/>
may come to true completion.</p>

<p class="calibre6">Through Christ our Lord.</p>

<h3 class="calibre2">Prayer over the People</h3>

<p class="calibre6">Direct, O Lord, we pray, <br class="wordsection"/>
the hearts of your faithful, <br class="wordsection"/>
and in your kindness grant your servants this grace: <br class="wordsection"/>
that, abiding in the love of you and their neighbour, <br class="wordsection"/>
they may fulfil the whole of your commands. </p>

<p class="calibre6">Through Christ our Lord.</p>
