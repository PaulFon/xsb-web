<p class="calibre6">Holy Father, <br class="wordsection"/>
who though urging all the faithful to perfect charity, <br class="wordsection"/>
never cease to prompt many<br class="wordsection"/>
to follow more closely in the footsteps of your Son,<br class="wordsection"/>
grant, we pray, <br class="wordsection"/>
that those you have chosen for this special calling may, <br class="wordsection"/>
by their way of life,<br class="wordsection"/>
show to the Church and the world<br class="wordsection"/>
a clear sign of your Kingdom.<br class="wordsection"/>
Through our Lord.</p>

<p class="rubric">Or, to be said by a religious
Priest:</p>

<p class="calibre6">Look with favour on your family, <br class="wordsection"/>
O Lord, and increase it always with new offspring, <br class="wordsection"/>
so that it may lead its sons (daughters) <br class="wordsection"/>
towards their goal of perfect charity<br class="wordsection"/>
and work effectively for the salvation of all. <br class="wordsection"/>
Through our Lord.</p>

the offering we bring you,<br class="wordsection"/>
and grant fraternal communion and spiritual freedom to all who set out joyfully<br class="wordsection"/>
