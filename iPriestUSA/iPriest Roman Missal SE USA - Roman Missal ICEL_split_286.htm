ORDINARY TIME </h2>

<h3 class="calibre2">The history of salvation</h3>

<p class="rubric">55. The following Preface is
said on Sundays in Ordinary Time. </p>

<p class="calibre6">The Lord be with you.</p>

<p class="response">And with your spirit.</p>

<p class="calibre6">Lift up your hearts.</p>

<p class="response">We lift them up to the Lord.</p>

<p class="calibre6">Let us give thanks to the Lord our God.</p>

<p class="response">It is right and just.</p>

<p class="calibre6">It is truly right and just, our duty and our
salvation, always and everywhere to give you thanks, Lord, holy Father,
almighty and eternal God, through Christ our Lord. </p>

<p class="calibre6">For by his birth he brought renewal to
humanity’s fallen state, and by his suffering, cancelled out our sins; by his
rising from the dead, he has opened the way to eternal life, and by ascending
to you, O Father, he has unlocked the gates of heaven. </p>

<p class="calibre6">And so, with the company of Angels and
Saints, we sing the hymn of your praise, as without end we acclaim: </p>

<p class="all">Holy, Holy, Holy Lord God of hosts.
Heaven and earth are full of your glory. Hosanna in the highest. Blessed is he
who comes in the name of the Lord. Hosanna in the highest.</p>
