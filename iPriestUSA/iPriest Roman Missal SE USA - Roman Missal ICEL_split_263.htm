<h3 class="calibre2">The two comings of Christ</h3>

<p class="rubric">33. The following Preface is
said in Masses of Advent from the First Sunday of Advent to 16 December and in
other Masses that are celebrated in Advent and have no proper Preface. </p>

<p class="calibre6">The Lord be with you.</p>

<p class="response">And with your spirit.</p>

<p class="calibre6">Lift up your hearts.</p>

<p class="response">We lift them up to the Lord.</p>

<p class="calibre6">Let us give thanks to the Lord our God.</p>

<p class="response">It is right and just.</p>

<p class="calibre6">It is truly right and just, our duty and our
salvation, always and everywhere to give you thanks, Lord, holy Father,
almighty and eternal God, through Christ our Lord. </p>

<p class="calibre6">For he assumed at his first coming the
lowliness of human flesh, and so fulfilled the design you formed long ago, and
opened for us the way to eternal salvation, that, when he comes again in glory
and majesty and all is at last made manifest, we who watch for that day may
inherit the great promise in which now we dare to hope. </p>

<p class="calibre6">And so, with Angels and Archangels, with
Thrones and Dominions, and with all the hosts and Powers of heaven, we sing the
hymn of your glory, as without end we acclaim: </p>

<p class="all">Holy, Holy, Holy Lord God of hosts.
Heaven and earth are full of your glory. Hosanna in the highest. Blessed is he
who comes in the name of the Lord. Hosanna in the highest.</p>
