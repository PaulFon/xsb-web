(MAUNDY THURSDAY)<br class="calibre4"/>
At the Evening Mass</h2>

<p class="rubric">The Mass of the Lord’s Supper is celebrated in the evening, at
a convenient time, with the full participation of the whole local community and
with all the Priests and ministers exercising their office.<br class="wordsection"/>
All Priests may concelebrate even if they have already concelebrated the Chrism
Mass on this day, or if they have to celebrate another Mass for the good of the
Christian faithful.<br class="wordsection"/>
Where a pastoral reason requires it, the local Ordinary may permit another Mass
to be celebrated in churches and oratories in the evening and, in case of genuine necessity, even in the morning, but only for the faithful who are in no
way able to participate in the evening Mass. Care should, nevertheless, be
taken that celebrations of this sort do not take place for the advantage of private persons or special small groups, and do not prejudice the evening Mass.<br class="wordsection"/>
Holy Communion may only be distributed to the faithful during Mass; but it may
be brought to the sick at any hour of the day.<br class="wordsection"/>
The altar may be decorated with flowers with a moderation that accords with the
character of this day. The tabernacle should be entirely empty; but a
sufficient amount of bread should be consecrated in this Mass for the Communion
of the clergy and the people on this and the following day.</p>

<p class="anth">Entrance Antiphon | Cf. Gal 6: 14</p>

<p class="ant">We should glory in the Cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, in whom is
our salvation, life and resurrection, through whom we are saved and delivered.</p>

is said.</p>

<p class="red">The Gloria in excelsis (Glory to God in the highest) is said.
While the hymn is being sung, bells are rung, and when it is finished, they
remain silent until The Gloria in excelsis of the Easter Vigil, unless, if
appropriate, the Diocesan Bishop has decided otherwise. Likewise, during this
same period, the organ and other musical instruments may be used only so as to
support the singing.</p>

<h3 class="calibre2">Collect</h3>

<p class="calibre6">Let us pray.</p>

<p class="rubric">And all pray in silence with the Priest for a while.</p>

<p class="calibre6">O God, who have called us to participate<br class="wordsection"/>
in this most sacred Supper,<br class="wordsection"/>
in which your Only Begotten Son,<br class="wordsection"/>
when about to hand himself over to death,<br class="wordsection"/>
entrusted to the Church a sacrifice new for all eternity, <br class="wordsection"/>
the banquet of his love,<br class="wordsection"/>
grant, we pray, that we may draw from so great a mystery,<br class="wordsection"/>
the fullness of charity and of life.</p>

<p class="calibre6">Through our Lord Jesus Christ, your Son,<br class="wordsection"/>
who lives and reigns with you in the unity of the Holy Spirit, <br class="wordsection"/>
one God, for ever and ever.</p>

<p class="rubric">After the proclamation of the Gospel, the Priest gives a homily
in which light is shed on the principal mysteries that are commemorated in this
Mass, namely, the institution of the Holy Eucharist and of the priestly Order,
and the commandment of the Lord concerning fraternal charity.</p>

<h3 class="calibre2">The Washing of Feet</h3>

<p class="rubric">After the Homily, where a pastoral reason suggests it, the
Washing of Feet follows. The men who have been chosen are led by the ministers
to seats prepared in a suitable place. Then the Priest (removing his chasuble
if necessary) goes to each one, and, with the help of the ministers, pours
water over each one’s feet and then dries them. Meanwhile some of the following
antiphons or other appropriate chants are sung. </p>

<p class="anth">Antiphon 1 | Cf. Jn 13: 4,5,15</p>

<p class="calibre6">After the Lord had risen from supper, he poured water into a basin<br class="wordsection"/>
and began to wash the feet of his disciples: he left them this example.</p>

<p class="anth">Antiphon 2 | Cf. Jn 13: 12,13,15</p>

<p class="calibre6">The Lord Jesus, after eating supper with his disciples, <br class="wordsection"/>
washed their feet and said to them:<br class="wordsection"/>
Do you know what I, your Lord and Master, have done for you? <br class="wordsection"/>
I have given you an example, that you should do likewise.</p>

<p class="anth">Antiphon 3 | Jn 13: 6,7,8</p>

<p class="calibre6">Lord, are you to wash my feet? Jesus said to him in answer:<br class="wordsection"/>
If I do not wash your feet, you will have no share with me.<br class="wordsection"/>
V. So he came to Simon Peter and Peter said to him:<br class="wordsection"/>
- Lord, are you to wash my feet? ...<br class="wordsection"/>
V. What I am doing, you do not know for now,<br class="wordsection"/>
but later you will come to know.<br class="wordsection"/>
- Lord, are you to wash my feet? ...</p>

<p class="anth">Antiphon 4 | Cf. Jn 13: 14</p>

<p class="calibre6">If I, your Lord and Master, have washed your feet, how much more should you
wash each other’s feet?</p>

<p class="anth">Antiphon 5 | Jn 13: 35</p>

<p class="calibre6">This is how all will know that you are my disciples: if you have love for
one another.<br class="wordsection"/>
V. Jesus said to his disciples:<br class="wordsection"/>
-This is how all will know ...</p>

<p class="anth">Antiphon 6 | Jn 13: 34</p>

<p class="calibre6">I give you a new commandment, that you love one another<br class="wordsection"/>
as I have loved you, says the Lord.</p>

<p class="anth">Antiphon 7 | 1 Cor 13:13</p>

<p class="calibre6">Let faith, hope and charity, these three, remain among you,<br class="wordsection"/>
but the greatest of these is charity.<br class="wordsection"/>
V. Now faith, hope and charity, these three, remain;<br class="wordsection"/>
but the greatest of these is charity. -Let.</p>

<p class="rubric">13. After the Washing of Feet, the Priest washes and dries his
hands, puts the chasuble back on, and returns to the chair, and from there he
directs the Universal Prayer. The Creed is not said.</p>

<h3 class="calibre2">The Liturgy of the Eucharist</h3>

<p class="rubric">At the beginning of the Liturgy of the Eucharist, there may be
a procession of the faithful in which gifts for the poor may be presented with
the bread and wine. Meanwhile the following, or another appropriate chant, is
sung.</p>

<p class="calibre6">Ant. Where true charity is dwelling, God is present there.</p>

<p class="calibre6">V. By the love of Christ we have been brought together: <br class="wordsection"/>
V. let us find in him our gladness and our pleasure;<br class="wordsection"/>
V. may we love him and revere him, God the living, <br class="wordsection"/>
V. and in love respect each other with sincere hearts.</p>

<p class="calibre6">Ant. Where true charity is dwelling, God is present there.</p>

<p class="calibre6">V. So when we are gathered all together,<br class="wordsection"/>
V. let us strive to keep our minds free of division;<br class="wordsection"/>
V. may there be an end to malice, strife and quarrels, <br class="wordsection"/>
V. and let Christ our God be dwelling here among us.</p>

<p class="calibre6">Ant. Where true charity is dwelling, God is present there.<br class="wordsection"/>
V. May your face thus be our vision, bright in glory,<br class="wordsection"/>
V. Christ our God, with all the blessed Saints in heaven: <br class="wordsection"/>
V. such delight is pure and faultless, joy unbounded,<br class="wordsection"/>
V. which endures through countless ages world without end. Amen.</p>

Gifts)</a></p>

<h3 class="calibre2">Prayer over the Offerings</h3>

<p class="calibre6">Grant us, O Lord, we pray,<br class="wordsection"/>
that we may participate worthily in these mysteries,<br class="wordsection"/>
for whenever the memorial of this sacrifice is celebrated <br class="wordsection"/>
the work of our redemption is accomplished.</p>

<p class="calibre6">Through Christ our Lord.</p>

<h3 class="calibre2">Preface: The Sacrifice and Sacrament of Christ. </h3>

<p class="calibre6">It is truly right and just, our duty and our salvation, always and
everywhere to give you thanks, Lord, holy Father, almighty and eternal God,
through Christ our Lord. </p>

<p class="calibre6">For he is the true and eternal Priest, <br class="wordsection"/>
who instituted the pattern of an everlasting sacrifice <br class="wordsection"/>
and was the first to offer himself as the saving Victim, <br class="wordsection"/>
commanding us to make this offering as his memorial. <br class="wordsection"/>
As we eat his flesh that was sacrificed for us, <br class="wordsection"/>
we are made strong, and, <br class="wordsection"/>
as we drink his Blood that was poured out for us, <br class="wordsection"/>
we are washed clean. </p>

<p class="calibre6">And so, with Angels and Archangels, with Thrones and Dominions,<br class="wordsection"/>
and with all the hosts and Powers of heaven, <br class="wordsection"/>
we sing the hymn of your glory, as without end we acclaim: </p>

<p class="all">Holy, Holy, Holy Lord God of hosts. Heaven and earth are full of your glory. Hosanna in the highest. Blessed is he who comes in the name of the
Lord. Hosanna in the highest.</p>

<p class="rubric">At an appropriate moment during
Communion, the Priest entrusts the Eucharist from the table of the altar to
Deacons or acolytes or other extraordinary ministers, so that afterwards it may
be brought to the sick who are to receive Holy Communion at home.</p>

do this, whenever you receive it, in memory of me.</p>

<p class="rubric">After the distribution of Communion, a ciborium with hosts for Communion on the following day is left on
the altar. The Priest, standing at the chair, says the Prayer after Communion.</p>

<h3 class="calibre2">Prayer after Communion</h3>

<p class="calibre6">Grant, almighty God,<br class="wordsection"/>
that, just as we are renewed<br class="wordsection"/>

<h3 class="calibre2">The Transfer of the Most Blessed Sacrament</h3>

<p class="rubric">After the Prayer after
Communion, the Priest puts incense in the thurible while standing, blesses it
and then, kneeling, incenses the Blessed Sacrament three times. Then, having
put on a white humeral veil, he rises, takes the ciborium, and covers it with
the ends of the veil.</p>

<p class="rubric">A procession is formed in which
the Blessed Sacrament, accompanied by torches and incense, is carried through
the church to a place of repose prepared in a part of the church or in a chapel
suitably decorated. A lay minister with a cross, standing between two other
ministers with lighted candles leads off. Others carrying lighted candles
follow. Before the Priest carrying the Blessed Sacrament comes the thurifer
with a smoking thurible. Meanwhile, the hymn Pange, lingua (exclusive of the
last two stanzas) or another eucharistic chant is sung.</p>

<p class="rubric">When the procession reaches the
place of repose, the Priest, with the help of the Deacon if necessary, places
the ciborium in the tabernacle, the door of which remains open. Then he puts
incense in the thurible and, kneeling, incenses the Blessed Sacrament, while
Tantum ergo Sacraméntum or another eucharistic chant is sung. Then the Deacon
or the Priest himself places the Sacrament in the tabernacle and closes the
