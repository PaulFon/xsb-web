<h3 class="calibre2">Prayer over the Offerings</h3>

<p class="rubric">If the newly ordained Bishop
presides at the Liturgy of the Eucharist, he says:</p>

<p class="calibre6">We offer you the sacrifice of praise, O Lord,
<br class="wordsection"/>
for the deepening of our service of you,<br class="wordsection"/>
so that what you have conferred, unworthy as we are,<br class="wordsection"/>
you may graciously bring to fulfillment. </p>

<p class="calibre6">Through Christ our Lord.</p>

<p class="rubric">If, however, the principal ordaining
Bishop presides at the Liturgy of the Eucharist, he says:</p>

<p class="calibre6">May this oblation, O Lord,<br class="wordsection"/>
presented for your Church<br class="wordsection"/>
and for <span class="red1">N.</span>, your servant and Bishop,<br class="wordsection"/>
become an offering acceptable to you;<br class="wordsection"/>
and for the good of the flock,<br class="wordsection"/>
may he whom you have raised up<br class="wordsection"/>
among your people to be High Priest<br class="wordsection"/>
be endowed, by your gift,<br class="wordsection"/>
with apostolic virtues.</p>

<p class="calibre6">Through Christ our Lord.</p>

<p class="rubric">This Preface may be said:</p>

<h3 class="calibre2">Preface: The Priesthood of Christ and the ministry of Priests.</h3>

<p class="calibre6">The Lord be with you.</p>

<p class="response">And with your spirit.</p>

<p class="calibre6">Lift up your hearts.</p>

<p class="response">We lift them up to the Lord.</p>

<p class="calibre6">Let us give thanks to the Lord our God.</p>

<p class="response">It is right and just.</p>

<p class="calibre6">It is truly right and just, our duty and our
salvation, <br class="wordsection"/>
always and everywhere to give you thanks,<br class="wordsection"/>
Lord, holy Father, almighty and eternal God.</p>

<p class="calibre6">For by the anointing of the Holy Spirit<br class="wordsection"/>
you constituted your Only Begotten Son<br class="wordsection"/>
High Priest of the new and eternal covenant,<br class="wordsection"/>
and by your wondrous plan were pleased to decree <br class="wordsection"/>
that his one Priesthood should continue in the Church.<br class="wordsection"/>
For Christ not only adorns with a royal priesthood <br class="wordsection"/>
the people he has made his own,<br class="wordsection"/>
but with a brother’s goodness <br class="wordsection"/>
he also chooses men to become sharers in his sacred ministry<br class="wordsection"/>
through the laying on of hands.</p>

<p class="calibre6">They are to renew in his Name<br class="wordsection"/>
the sacrifice of human redemption,<br class="wordsection"/>
to set before your children the paschal banquet, <br class="wordsection"/>
to lead your holy people in charity,<br class="wordsection"/>
to nourish them with your word,<br class="wordsection"/>
and to strengthen them with the Sacraments.</p>

<p class="calibre6">As they give up their lives for you<br class="wordsection"/>
and for the salvation of their brothers and sisters,<br class="wordsection"/>
they strive to be conformed to the image of Christ himself, <br class="wordsection"/>
and offer you a constant witness of faith and love.</p>

<p class="calibre6">And so, Lord, with all the Angels and Saints,<br class="wordsection"/>
we, too, give you thanks as in exultation we acclaim:</p>

<p class="all">Holy, Holy, Holy Lord God of hosts.
Heaven and earth are full of your glory. Hosanna in the highest. Blessed is he
who comes in the name of the Lord. Hosanna in the highest.</p>

<p class="rubric">Mention of the newly ordained
Bishop is made according to the following formulas: <br class="wordsection"/>
a) In Eucharistic Prayer I, the newly ordained Bishop says the proper form of
Hanc igitur (Therefore, Lord, we pray):</p>

<p class="calibre6">Therefore, Lord, we pray:<br class="wordsection"/>
graciously accept this oblation of our service, <br class="wordsection"/>
that of your whole family,<br class="wordsection"/>
which we make to you<br class="wordsection"/>
for me, too, your unworthy servant,<br class="wordsection"/>
whom you have been pleased to raise to the Order of Bishops; <br class="wordsection"/>
in your mercy, we pray, keep safe your gifts in me,<br class="wordsection"/>
so that what I have received by divine commission <br class="wordsection"/>
I may fulfil by divine assistance.</p>

<p class="quietly"><span class="red1"><span class="calibre14">(</span></span>Through
Christ our Lord. Amen.<span class="red1"><span class="calibre14">)</span></span> </p>

<p class="rubric">Another Bishop, however, says:</p>

<p class="calibre6">Therefore, Lord, we pray:<br class="wordsection"/>

that of your whole family, <br class="wordsection"/>
which we make to you also for your servant <span class="red1">N.</span>,<br class="wordsection"/>
whom you have been pleased to raise to the Order of Bishops;<br class="wordsection"/>
in your mercy, we pray, keep safe your gifts in him,<br class="wordsection"/>

<p class="quietly"><span class="red1"><span class="calibre14">(</span></span>Through
Christ our Lord. Amen.<span class="red1"><span class="calibre14">)</span></span> </p>

<p class="rubric">b) In Eucharistic Prayer II,
after the words we may be gathered into one by the Holy Spirit, the newly
ordained Bishop says: </p>

<p class="calibre6">Remember, Lord, your Church, <br class="wordsection"/>

and bring her to the fullness of charity, <br class="wordsection"/>
together with <span class="red1">Francis</span> our Pope<br class="wordsection"/>

as shepherd for the Church (of <span class="red1">N.</span>), and all the clergy.</p>

<p class="calibre6">Remember also our brothers and sisters ...</p>

<p class="rubric">Another Bishop, however, says:</p>

<p class="calibre6">Remember also our brothers and sisters ...</p>

<p class="rubric">c) In Eucharistic Prayer III,
after the words advance the peace and salvation of all the world, the newly
ordained Bishop says: </p>

<p class="calibre6">Be pleased to confirm in faith and charity<br class="wordsection"/>
your pilgrim Church on earth, <br class="wordsection"/>
with your servant <span class="red1">Francis</span> our Pope (and <span class="red1">N.</span> our
Bishop),<br class="wordsection"/>

who have been ordained today as shepherd for the Church (of <span class="red1">N.</span>),<br class="wordsection"/>
with the Order of Bishops, all the clergy,<br class="wordsection"/>
and the entire people you have gained for your own.</p>

<p class="calibre6">Listen graciously to the prayers of this
family…</p>

<p class="rubric">Another Bishop, however, says:</p>

<p class="calibre6">Listen graciously to the prayers of this
family …</p>

<p class="rubric">d) If the proper Preface is not
used, Eucharistic Prayer IV may be said; in the intercessions of this prayer,
after the words to the praise of your glory, the newly ordained Bishop says:</p>

<p class="calibre6">Therefore, Lord, remember now<br class="wordsection"/>
all for whom we offer you this sacrifice:<br class="wordsection"/>
especially your servant <span class="red1">Francis</span> our Pope,<br class="wordsection"/>

<p class="ant">Holy Father, consecrate them in the
truth. As you sent me into the world, so I sent them into the world, says the
Lord (alleluia).</p>

<h3 class="calibre2">Prayer after Communion</h3>

<p class="rubric">If the newly ordained Bishop
presides at the Liturgy of the Eucharist, he says:</p>

<p class="calibre6">Complete within us, O Lord, we pray, <br class="wordsection"/>

that through your grace you have laid upon me,<br class="wordsection"/>

may never fail the shepherd <br class="wordsection"/>
nor the care of the shepherd be lacking for the flock.</p>

<p class="response">Amen.</p>
