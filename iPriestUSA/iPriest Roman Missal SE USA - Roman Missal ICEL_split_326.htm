<p class="rubric"><img border="0" id="_x0000_i1186" src="pc.gif" class="calibre12"/>100.
The Priest, with hands extended, says: </p>

<p class="calibre6">You are indeed Holy, O Lord, <br class="wordsection"/>
the fount of all holiness. </p>

<p class="rubric"><img border="0" id="_x0000_i1185" src="cc.gif" class="calibre12"/>101.
He joins his hands and, holding them extended over the offerings, says: </p>

<p class="calibre6">Make holy, therefore, these gifts, we pray, <br class="wordsection"/>
by sending down your Spirit upon them like the dewfall, </p>

<p class="rubric">He joins his hands and makes the
Sign of the Cross once over the bread and the chalice together, saying: </p>

<p class="calibre6">so that they may become for us <br class="wordsection"/>
the Body and <span class="red1">+</span> Blood of our Lord Jesus Christ. </p>

<p class="rubric">He joins his hands. </p>

<p class="rubric">102. In the formulas that
follow, the words of the Lord should be pronounced clearly and distinctly, as
the nature of these words requires. </p>

<p class="calibre6">At the time he was betrayed <br class="wordsection"/>
and entered willingly into his Passion, </p>

<p class="rubric">He takes the bread and, holding
it slightly raised above the altar, continues: </p>

<p class="calibre6">he took bread and, giving thanks, broke it, <br class="wordsection"/>
and gave it to his disciples, saying: </p>

<p class="rubric">He bows slightly. </p>

<p class="calibre6">TAKE THIS, ALL OF YOU, AND EAT OF IT, <br class="wordsection"/>
FOR THIS IS MY BODY, WHICH WILL BE GIVEN UP FOR YOU.</p>

<p class="rubric">He shows the consecrated host to
the people, places it again on the paten, and genuflects in adoration. </p>

<p class="rubric">103. After this, he continues: </p>

<p class="calibre6">In a similar way, when supper was ended, </p>

<p class="rubric">He takes the chalice and,
holding it slightly raised above the altar, continues: </p>

<p class="calibre6">he took the chalice and, once more giving
thanks, <br class="wordsection"/>
he gave it to his disciples, saying: </p>

<p class="rubric">He bows slightly. </p>

<p class="calibre6">TAKE THIS, ALL OF YOU, AND DRINK FROM IT, <br class="wordsection"/>
FOR THIS IS THE CHALICE OF MY BLOOD, <br class="wordsection"/>
THE BLOOD OF THE NEW AND ETERNAL COVENANT, <br class="wordsection"/>
WHICH WILL BE POURED OUT FOR YOU <br class="wordsection"/>
AND FOR MANY FOR THE FORGIVENESS OF SINS. </p>

<p class="calibre6">DO THIS IN MEMORY OF ME. </p>

<p class="rubric">He shows the chalice to the
people, places it on the corporal, and genuflects in adoration. </p>

<p class="rubric"><img border="0" id="_x0000_i1184" src="pc.gif" class="calibre12"/>104.
Then he says: </p>

<p class="calibre6">The mystery of faith. </p>

<p class="rubric">And the people continue,
acclaiming: </p>

<p class="response">We proclaim your Death, O
Lord, <br class="wordsection"/>
and profess your Resurrection until you come again. </p>

<p class="rubric">or: </p>

<p class="response">When we eat this Bread and
drink this Cup, <br class="wordsection"/>
we proclaim your Death, O Lord, until you come again. </p>

<p class="rubric">or: </p>

<p class="response">Save us, Saviour of the world,
<br class="wordsection"/>
for by your Cross and Resurrection you have set us free. </p>

<p class="rubric"><img border="0" id="_x0000_i1183" src="cc.gif" class="calibre12"/>105.
Then the Priest, with hands extended, says: </p>

<p class="calibre6">Therefore, as we celebrate the memorial <br class="wordsection"/>
of his Death and Resurrection, <br class="wordsection"/>
we offer you, Lord, <br class="wordsection"/>
the Bread of life and the Chalice of salvation, <br class="wordsection"/>
giving thanks that you have held us worthy <br class="wordsection"/>
to be in your presence and minister to you. </p>

<p class="calibre6">Humbly we pray that, <br class="wordsection"/>
partaking of the Body and Blood of Christ, <br class="wordsection"/>
we may be gathered into one by the Holy Spirit. </p>

<p class="calibre6"><img border="0" id="_x0000_i1182" src="c1.gif" class="calibre12"/>Remember,
Lord, your Church, <br class="wordsection"/>
spread throughout the world, <br class="wordsection"/>
and bring her to the fullness of charity, <br class="wordsection"/>
together with <span class="red1">Francis</span> our Pope and <span class="red1">N.</span> our
Bishop<span class="red1">*</span> <br class="wordsection"/>
and all the clergy. </p>

<p class="calibre6">Remember also, Lord, your servants<br class="wordsection"/>
whom you have been pleased to confirm today <br class="wordsection"/>
by bestowing the Holy Spirit:<br class="wordsection"/>
keep them, we pray, in your grace.</p>

<p class="rubric">* Mention may be made here of the Coadjutor Bishop, or Auxiliary Bishops, as noted in the General Instruction
of the Roman Missal, no. 149. </p>

<p class="calibre6"><img border="0" id="_x0000_i1181" src="c2.gif" class="calibre12"/>Remember
also our brothers and sisters <br class="wordsection"/>
who have fallen asleep in the hope of the resurrection, <br class="wordsection"/>
and all who have died in your mercy: <br class="wordsection"/>
welcome them into the light of your face. </p>

<p class="calibre6">Have mercy on us all, we pray, that with the
Blessed Virgin Mary, Mother of God, with blessed Joseph, her Spouse, with the
blessed Apostles, and all the Saints who have pleased you throughout the ages,
we may merit to be coheirs to eternal life, and may praise and glorify you </p>

<p class="rubric">He joins his hands. </p>

<p class="calibre6">through your Son, Jesus Christ. </p>

<p class="rubric"><img border="0" id="_x0000_i1180" src="pcc.gif" class="calibre12"/>106.
He takes the chalice and the paten with the host and, raising both, he says: </p>

<p class="calibre6">Through him, and with him, and in him, <br class="wordsection"/>
O God, almighty Father, <br class="wordsection"/>
in the unity of the Holy Spirit, <br class="wordsection"/>
all glory and honour is yours, <br class="wordsection"/>
for ever and ever.</p>

<p class="rubric">The people acclaim: </p>

<p class="response">Amen. | <a href="iPriest%20Roman%20Missal%20SE%20USA%20-%20Roman%20Missal%20ICEL_split_347.htm#CR">Then follows the Communion Rite.</a></p>
