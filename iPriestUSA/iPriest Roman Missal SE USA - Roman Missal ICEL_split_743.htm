<p class="rubric">These Masses may be used with
the colour violet when the Scrutinies for the catechumens who are to be
admitted to the Sacraments of Christian Initiation at the Easter Vigil are
celebrated at the time proper for them, namely, on the Third, Fourth, and Fifth
Sundays of Lent. If, however, for pastoral reasons, the Scrutinies cannot take
place on these Sundays, other appropriate weekdays may be chosen in Lent, or,
whenever Baptism is to be conferred outside the Easter Vigil, also at other
times of the year. Nevertheless, in the first Mass of the Scrutinies, the
Gospel of the Samaritan Woman is always read, in the second, that of the Man
born blind, in the third, that of Lazarus, as given respectively for the Third,
Fourth, and Fifth Sundays of Lent.</p>

he had already created the gift of faith within her<br class="wordsection"/>

<p class="calibre6">And so we, too, give you thanks<br class="wordsection"/>

praise your mighty deeds, as we acclaim:</p>

<p class="rubric">He shows the consecrated host to

command that these gifts be borne <br class="wordsection"/>

<p class="rubric">He joins his hands and prays
