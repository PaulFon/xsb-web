<h2 id="calibre_toc_878" class="calibre10">III. Mass at which only One Minister Participates</h2>

<p class="girm">252. At a Mass celebrated by a Priest with only one minister to
assist him and to make the responses, the rite of Mass with the people is
followed (cf. nos. 120-169), the minister saying the people’s parts if
appropriate.</p>

<p class="girm">253. If, however, the minister is a Deacon, he performs his
proper functions (cf. nos. 171-186) and likewise carries out the other parts,
that is, those of the people.</p>

<p class="girm">254. Mass should not be celebrated without a minister, or at
least one of the faithful, except for a just and reasonable cause. In this
case, the greetings, the instructions, and the blessing at the end of Mass are
omitted.</p>

<p class="girm">255. Before Mass, the necessary vessels are prepared either at
the credence table or on the right hand side of the altar.</p>

<h4 class="calibre5">The Introductory Rites</h4>

<p class="girm">256. The Priest approaches the altar and, after making a profound
bow along with the minister, venerates the altar with a kiss and goes to the
chair. If he wishes, the Priest may remain at the altar; in which case, the
Missal is also prepared there. Then the minister or the Priest says the
Entrance Antiphon.</p>

<p class="girm">257. Then the Priest, standing, makes with the minister the Sign
of the Cross as the Priest says, In the name of the Father, etc. Facing the
minister, he greets him, choosing one of the formulas provided.</p>

<p class="calibre6">258. Then the Penitential Act takes place, and, in accordance with
the rubrics, the Kyrie and the Gloria in excelsis (Glory to God in the highest)
are said.</p>

<p class="girm">259. Then, with hands joined, the Priest pronounces, Let us pray,
and after a suitable pause, with hands extended he pronounces the Collect. At
the end the minister acclaims, Amen.</p>

<h4 class="calibre5">The Liturgy of the Word</h4>

<p class="girm">260. The readings should, in so far as possible, be proclaimed
from the ambo or a lectern.</p>

<p class="girm">261. After the Collect, the minister reads the First Reading and Psalm,
the Second Reading, when it is to be said, and the verse of the Alleluia or
other chant.</p>

<p class="girm">262. Then the Priest, bowing profoundly, says the prayer Munda
cor meum (Cleanse my heart) and after this reads the Gospel. At the end he
says, The Gospel of the Lord, to which the minister replies, Praise to you,
Lord Jesus Christ. The Priest then venerates the book with a kiss, saying
quietly the formula Per evangelica dicta (Through the words of the Gospel).</p>

<p class="girm">263. After this, the Priest says the Symbol or Creed, in
accordance with the rubrics, together with the minister.</p>

<p class="girm">264. The Universal Prayer follows, which may be said even in this
form of Mass. The Priest introduces and concludes it, with the minister
announcing the intentions.</p>

<h4 class="calibre5">The Liturgy of the Eucharist</h4>

<p class="girm">265. In the Liturgy of the Eucharist, everything is done as at
Mass with the people, except for the following.</p>

<p class="girm">266. After the acclamation at the end of the embolism that
follows the Lord’s Prayer, the Priest says the prayer Domine Iesu Christe, qui
dixisti (Lord Jesus Christ, who said to your Apostles). He then adds, The peace
of the Lord be with you always, to which the minister replies, And with your
spirit. If appropriate, the Priest gives the Sign of Peace to the minister.</p>

<p class="girm">267. Then, while he says the Agnus Dei (Lamb of God) with the
minister, the Priest breaks the host over the paten. After the Agnus Dei (Lamb
of God), he performs the commingling, saying quietly the prayer Haec commixtio
(May this mingling).</p>

<p class="girm">268. After the commingling, the Priest quietly says either the
prayer Domine Iesu Christe, Fili Dei vivi (Lord Jesus Christ, Son of the living
God) or the prayer Perceptio Corporis et Sanguinis tui (May the receiving of
your Body and Blood). Then he genuflects, takes the host, and, if the minister is
to receive Communion, turns to the minister and, holding the host a little
above the paten or the chalice, says the Ecce Agnus Dei (Behold the Lamb of
God), adding with the minister, Lord, I am not worthy. Then facing the altar,
the Priest partakes of the Body of Christ. If, however, the minister does not
receive Communion, the Priest, after genuflecting, takes the host and, facing
the altar, says quietly, Lord, I am not worthy, etc., and the Corpus Christi
custodiat me in vitam aeternam (May the Body of Christ keep me safe for eternal
life), and consumes the Body of Christ. Then he takes the chalice and says
quietly, Sanguis Christi custodiat me in vitam aeternam (May the Blood of
Christ keep me safe for eternal life), and consumes the Blood of Christ.</p>

<p class="girm">269. Before Communion is given to the minister, the Communion
Antiphon is said by the minister or by the Priest himself.</p>

<p class="girm">270. The Priest purifies the chalice at the credence table or at
the altar. If the chalice is purified at the altar, it may be carried to the
credence table by the minister or may be arranged once again on the altar, at
the side.</p>

<p class="girm">271. After the purification of the chalice, the Priest should
observe a brief pause for silence, and after this he says the Prayer after
Communion.</p>

<h4 class="calibre5">The Concluding Rites</h4>

<p class="girm">272. The Concluding Rites are carried out as at a Mass with the
people, but the Ite, missa est (Go forth, the Mass is ended) is omitted. The
Priest venerates the altar as usual with a kiss and, after making a profound
bow with the minister, withdraws.</p>

<h5 class="calibre31">IV. Some General Norms for All Forms of Mass</h5>

<h4 class="calibre5">Veneration of the Altar and the Book of the Gospels</h4>

<p class="girm">273. According to traditional practice, the veneration of the
altar and of the Book of the Gospels is done by means of a kiss. However, where
a sign of this kind is not in harmony with the traditions or the culture of
some region, it is for the Conference of Bishops to establish some other sign
in its place, with the consent of the Apostolic See.</p>

<h4 class="calibre5">Genuflections and Bows</h4>

<p class="girm">274. A genuflection, made by bending the right knee to the
ground, signifies adoration, and therefore it is reserved for the Most Blessed
Sacrament, as well as for the Holy Cross from the solemn adoration during the
liturgical celebration on Good Friday until the beginning of the Easter Vigil.</p>

<p class="girm">During Mass, three genuflections are made by the Priest
Celebrant: namely, after the elevation of the host, after the elevation of the
chalice, and before Communion. Certain specific features to be observed in a
concele-brated Mass are noted in their proper place (cf. nos. 210-251).</p>

<p class="girm">If, however, the tabernacle with the Most Blessed Sacrament is
situated in the sanctuary, the Priest, the Deacon, and the other ministers
genuflect when they approach the altar and when they depart from it, but not
during the celebration of Mass itself.</p>

<p class="girm">Otherwise, all who pass before the Most Blessed Sacrament
genuflect, unless they are moving in procession.</p>

<p class="girm">Ministers carrying the processional cross or candles bow their
heads instead of genuflecting.</p>

<p class="girm">275. A bow signifies reverence and honour shown to the persons
themselves or to the signs that represent them. There are two kinds of bow: a
bow of the head and a bow of the body.</p>

<p class="girm">a) A bow of the head is made when the three Divine Persons are
named together and at the names of Jesus, of the Blessed Virgin Mary, and of
the Saint in whose honour Mass is being celebrated.</p>

<p class="girm">b) A bow of the body, that is to say, a profound bow, is made to
the altar; during the prayers Munda cor meum (Cleanse my heart) and In spiritu
humilitatis (With humble spirit); in the Creed at the words et incarnatus est
(and by the Holy Spirit... and became man); in the Roman Canon at the Supplices
te rogamus (In humble prayer we ask you, almighty God). The same kind of bow is
made by the Deacon when he asks for a blessing before the proclamation of the
Gospel. In addition, the Priest bows slightly as he pronounces the words of the
Lord at the Consecration.</p>

<h4 class="calibre5">Incensation</h4>

<p class="girm">276. Thurification or incensation is an expression of reverence
and of prayer, as is signified in Sacred Scripture (cf. Ps 141 [140]:2; Rev
8:3).</p>

<p class="girm">Incense may be used optionally in any form of Mass:</p>

<p class="girm">a) during the Entrance Procession;</p>

<p class="girm">b) at the beginning of Mass, to incense the cross and the altar;</p>

<p class="girm">c) at the procession before the Gospel and the proclamation of the
Gospel itself;</p>

<p class="girm">d) after the bread and the chalice have been placed on the altar,
to incense the offerings, the cross, and the altar, as well as the Priest and
the people;</p>

<p class="girm">e) at the elevation of the host and the chalice after the
Consecration.</p>

<p class="girm">277. The Priest, having put incense into the thurible, blesses it
with the Sign of the Cross, without saying anything.</p>

<p class="girm">Before and after an incensation, a profound bow is made to the
person or object that is incensed, except for the altar and the offerings for
the Sacrifice of the Mass.</p>

<p class="girm">Three swings of the thurible are used to incense: the Most
Blessed Sacrament, a relic of the Holy Cross and images of the Lord exposed for
public veneration, the offerings for the Sacrifice of the Mass, the altar
cross, the Book of the Gospels, the paschal candle, the Priest, and the people.</p>

<p class="girm">Two swings of the thurible are used to incense relics and images
of the Saints exposed for public veneration; this should be done, however, only
at the beginning of the celebration, following the incensation of the altar.</p>

<p class="girm">The altar is incensed with single swings of the thurible in this
way:</p>

<p class="girm">a) if the altar is freestanding with respect to the wall, the
Priest incenses walking around it;</p>

<p class="girm">b) if the altar is not freestanding, the Priest incenses it while
walking first to the right hand side, then to the left.</p>

<p class="girm">The cross, if situated on the altar or near it, is incensed by
the Priest before he incenses the altar; otherwise, he incenses it when he
passes in front of it.</p>

<p class="girm">The Priest incenses the offerings with three swings of the
thurible or by making the Sign of the Cross over the offerings with the
thurible before going on to incense the cross and the altar.</p>

<h4 class="calibre5">The Purification</h4>

<p class="girm">278. Whenever a fragment of the host adheres to his fingers,
especially after the fraction or after the Communion of the faithful, the
Priest should wipe his fingers over the paten or, if necessary, wash them.
Likewise, he should also gather any fragments that may have fallen outside the
paten.</p>

<p class="girm">279. The sacred vessels are purified by the Priest, the Deacon,
or an instituted acolyte after Communion or after Mass, in so far as possible
at the credence table. The purification of the chalice is done with water alone
or with wine and water, which is then consumed by whoever does the purification.
The paten is wiped clean as usual with the purificator.</p>

<p class="girm">Care is to be taken that whatever may remain of the Blood of
Christ after the distribution of Communion is consumed immediately and
completely at the altar.</p>

<p class="girm">280. If a host or any particle should fall, it is to be picked up
reverently; and if any of the Precious Blood is spilled, the area where the
spill occurred should be washed with water, and this water should then be
poured into the sacrarium in the sacristy.</p>

<h4 class="calibre5">Communion under Both Kinds</h4>

<p class="girm">281. Holy Communion has a fuller form as a sign when it takes
place under both kinds. For in this form the sign of the Eucharistic banquet is
more clearly evident and clearer expression is given to the divine will by
which the new and eternal Covenant is ratified in the Blood of the Lord, as
also the connection between the Eucharistic banquet and the eschatological
banquet in the Kingdom of the Father.<a href="iPriest%20Roman%20Missal%20SE%20USA%20-%20Roman%20Missal%20ICEL_split_884.htm#fn-104"> [104]</a><a id="fn-104-bl"></a></p>

<p class="girm">282. Sacred pastors should take care to ensure that the faithful
who participate in the rite or are present at it, are made aware by the most
suitable means possible of the Catholic teaching on the form of Holy Communion
as laid down by the Ecumenical Council of Trent. Above all, they should
instruct the Christian faithful that the Catholic faith teaches that Christ,
whole and entire, and the true Sacrament, is received even under only one
species, and hence that as regards the resulting fruits, those who receive
under only one species are not deprived of any grace that is necessary for
salvation.<a href="iPriest%20Roman%20Missal%20SE%20USA%20-%20Roman%20Missal%20ICEL_split_884.htm#fn-105"> [105]</a><a id="fn-105-bl"></a></p>

<p class="girm">Furthermore, they should teach that the Church, in her
administration of the Sacraments, has the power to lay down or alter whatever
provisions, apart from the substance of the Sacraments, that she judges to be
more readily conducive to reverence for the Sacraments and the good of the
recipients, in view of changing conditions, times, and places.<a href="iPriest%20Roman%20Missal%20SE%20USA%20-%20Roman%20Missal%20ICEL_split_884.htm#fn-106">
[106]</a><a id="fn-106-bl"></a> However, at the same time the faithful should
be instructed to participate more readily in this sacred rite, by which the
sign of the Eucharistic banquet is made more fully evident.</p>

<p class="girm">283. In addition to those cases given in the ritual books,
Communion under both kinds is permitted for:</p>

<p class="girm">a) Priests who are not able to celebrate or concelebrate Mass;</p>

<p class="girm">b) the Deacon and others who perform some duty at the Mass;</p>

<p class="girm">c) members of communities at the Conventual Mass or the
“community” Mass, along with seminarians, and all those engaged in a retreat or
taking part in a spiritual or pastoral gathering.</p>

<p class="girm">The Diocesan Bishop may establish norms for Communion under both
kinds for his own diocese, which are also to be observed in churches of
religious and at celebrations with small groups. The Diocesan Bishop is also
given the faculty to permit Communion under both kinds whenever it may seem
appropriate to the Priest to whom a community has been entrusted as its own
shepherd, provided that the faithful have been well instructed and that there
is no danger of profanation of the Sacrament or of the rite’s becoming
difficult because of the large number of participants or for some other cause.</p>

<p class="girm">In all that pertains to Communion under both kinds, the Norms for
the Distribution and Reception of Holy Communion under Both Kinds in the Dioceses
of the United States of America are to be followed (particularly nos. 27-54).</p>

<p class="girm">284. When Communion is distributed under both kinds:</p>

<p class="girm">a) the chalice is usually administered by a Deacon or, in the
absence of a Deacon, by a Priest, or even by a duly instituted acolyte or
another extraordinary minister of Holy Communion, or by one of the faithful
who, in a case of necessity, has been entrusted with this duty for a single
occasion;</p>

<p class="girm">b) whatever may remain of the Blood of Christ is consumed at the
altar by the Priest or the Deacon or the duly instituted acolyte who ministered
the chalice. The same then purifies, wipes, and arranges the sacred vessels in
the usual way.</p>

<p class="girm">Any of the faithful who wish to receive Holy Communion under the
species of bread alone should be given Communion in this form.</p>

<p class="girm">285. For Communion under both kinds the following should be
prepared:</p>

<p class="girm">a) If Communion from the chalice is done by drinking directly
from the chalice, a chalice of a sufficiently large size or several chalices
are prepared. However, care should be taken lest beyond what is needed of the
Blood of Christ remains to be consumed at the end of the celebration.</p>

<p class="girm">b) If Communion from the chalice is done by intinction, the hosts
should be neither too thin nor too small, but rather a little thicker than
usual, so that after being intincted partly into the Blood of Christ they can
still be easily distributed.</p>

<p class="girm">286. If Communion of the Blood of Christ is carried out by
communicants’ drinking from the chalice, each communicant, after receiving the
Body of Christ, moves to the minister of the chalice and stands facing him. The
minister says, The Blood of Christ, the communicant replies, Amen, and the
minister hands over the chalice, which the communicant raises to his or her
mouth. Each communicant drinks a little from the chalice, hands it back to the
minister, and then withdraws; the minister wipes the rim of the chalice with
the purificator.</p>

<p class="girm">287. If Communion from the chalice is carried out by intinction,
each communicant, holding a Communion-plate under the mouth, approaches the
Priest who holds a vessel with the sacred particles, with a minister standing
at his side and holding the chalice. The Priest takes a host, intincts it
partly in the chalice and, showing it, says, The Body and Blood of Christ. The
communicant replies, Amen, receives the Sacrament in the mouth from the Priest,
and then withdraws.</p>
