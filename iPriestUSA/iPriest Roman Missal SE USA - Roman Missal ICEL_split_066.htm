<h3 class="calibre2">Prayer over the Offerings</h3>

<p class="calibre6">Give us the right dispositions, O Lord, we pray, <br class="wordsection"/>
to make these offerings,<br class="wordsection"/>
for with them we celebrate the beginning <br class="wordsection"/>
of this venerable and sacred time.</p>

<p class="calibre6">Through Christ our Lord.</p>

<h3 class="calibre2">Preface: The Temptation of the Lord.</h3>

<p class="calibre6">The Lord be with you.</p>

<p class="response">And with your spirit.</p>

<p class="calibre6">Lift up your hearts.</p>

<p class="response">We lift them up to the Lord.</p>

<p class="calibre6">Let us give thanks to the Lord our God.</p>

<p class="response">It is right and just.</p>

<p class="calibre6">It is truly right and just, our duty and our salvation, <br class="wordsection"/>
always and everywhere to give you thanks,<br class="wordsection"/>
Lord, holy Father, almighty and eternal God, <br class="wordsection"/>
through Christ our Lord.</p>

<p class="calibre6">By abstaining forty long days from earthly food, <br class="wordsection"/>
he consecrated through his fast<br class="wordsection"/>
the pattern of our Lenten observance<br class="wordsection"/>
and, by overturning all the snares of the ancient serpent, <br class="wordsection"/>
taught us to cast out the leaven of malice,<br class="wordsection"/>
so that, celebrating worthily the Paschal Mystery,<br class="wordsection"/>
we might pass over at last to the eternal paschal feast.</p>

<p class="calibre6">And so, with the company of Angels and Saints, <br class="wordsection"/>
we sing the hymn of your praise,<br class="wordsection"/>
as without end we acclaim:</p>

<p class="all">Holy, Holy, Holy Lord God of hosts. Heaven and earth are full of your glory. Hosanna in the highest. Blessed is he who comes in the name of the
Lord. Hosanna in the highest.</p>

<h3 class="calibre2">Prayer after Communion</h3>

<p class="calibre6">Renewed now with heavenly bread,<br class="wordsection"/>
by which faith is nourished, hope increased,<br class="wordsection"/>
and charity strengthened, we pray, O Lord,<br class="wordsection"/>
that we may learn to hunger for Christ,<br class="wordsection"/>
the true and living Bread,<br class="wordsection"/>
and strive to live by every word<br class="wordsection"/>
which proceeds from your mouth.</p>

<p class="calibre6">Through Christ our Lord.</p>

<h3 class="calibre2">Prayer over the People</h3>

come down upon your people,<br class="wordsection"/>
that hope may grow in tribulation,<br class="wordsection"/>
virtue be strengthened in temptation, <br class="wordsection"/>
and eternal redemption be assured.</p>

<p class="calibre6">Through Christ our Lord.</p>
