<h2 id="calibre_toc_873" class="calibre10">Introduction</h2>

<p class="girm">1. As Christ the Lord was about to celebrate with the disciples
the paschal supper in which he instituted the Sacrifice of his Body and Blood,
he commanded that a large, furnished upper room be prepared (Lk 22:12). Indeed,
the Church has always judged that this command also applied to herself whenever
she decided about things related to the disposition of people’s minds, and of
places, rites, and texts for the Celebration of the Most Holy Eucharist. The present
norms, too, prescribed in keeping with the will of the Second Vatican Council,
together with the new Missal with which the Church of the Roman Rite will
henceforth celebrate the Mass, are again a demonstration of this same
solicitude of the Church, of her faith and her unaltered love for the supreme
mystery of the Eucharist, and also attest to her continuous and consistent
tradition, even though certain new elements have been introduced.</p>

<h4 class="calibre5">Testimony of an Unaltered Faith</h4>

<p class="girm">2. The sacrificial nature of the Mass, solemnly defended by the
Council of Trent, because it accords with the universal tradition of the
Church,<a href="iPriest%20Roman%20Missal%20SE%20USA%20-%20Roman%20Missal%20ICEL_split_884.htm#fn-1"> [1]</a><a id="fn-1-bl"></a> was once more stated by the
Second Vatican Council, which pronounced these clear words about the Mass: “At
the Last Supper, Our Saviour instituted the Eucharistic Sacrifice of his Body
and Blood, by which the Sacrifice of his Cross is perpetuated until he comes
again; and till then he entrusts the memorial of his Death and Resurrection to
his beloved spouse, the Church.”<a href="iPriest%20Roman%20Missal%20SE%20USA%20-%20Roman%20Missal%20ICEL_split_884.htm#fn-2"> [2]</a><a id="fn-2-bl"></a></p>

<p class="girm">What is taught in this way by the Council is consistently
expressed in the formulas of the Mass. Moreover, the doctrine which stands out
in the following sentence, already notable and concisely expressed in the
ancient Sacramentary commonly called the Leonine-“for whenever the memorial of
this sacrifice is celebrated the work of our redemption is accomplished”<a href="iPriest%20Roman%20Missal%20SE%20USA%20-%20Roman%20Missal%20ICEL_split_884.htm#fn-3"> [3]</a><a id="fn-3-bl"></a>-is aptly and exactly expounded in the
Eucharistic Prayers; for as in these the Priest enacts the anamnesis, while
turned towards God likewise in the name of all the people, he renders thanks
and offers the living and holy sacrifice, that is, the Church’s oblation and
the sacrificial Victim by whose death God himself willed to reconcile us to
himself;<a href="iPriest%20Roman%20Missal%20SE%20USA%20-%20Roman%20Missal%20ICEL_split_884.htm#fn-4"> [4]</a><a id="fn-4-bl"></a> and the Priest also prays
that the Body and Blood of Christ may be a sacrifice which is acceptable to the
Father and which brings salvation to the whole world.<a href="iPriest%20Roman%20Missal%20SE%20USA%20-%20Roman%20Missal%20ICEL_split_884.htm#fn-5"> [5]</a><a id="fn-5-bl"></a></p>

<p class="girm">So, in the new Missal the rule of prayer (lex orandi) of the
Church corresponds to her perennial rule of faith (lex credendi), by which we
are truly taught that the sacrifice of his Cross and its sacramental renewal in
the Mass, which Christ the Lord instituted at the Last Supper and commanded his
Apostles to do in his memory, are one and the same, differing only in the
manner of their offering; and as a result, that the Mass is at one and the same
time a sacrifice of praise, thanksgiving, propitiation, and satisfaction.</p>

<p class="girm">3. Moreover, the wondrous mystery of the real presence of the
Lord under the Eucharistic species, confirmed by the Second Vatican Council<a href="iPriest%20Roman%20Missal%20SE%20USA%20-%20Roman%20Missal%20ICEL_split_884.htm#fn-6"> [6]</a><a id="fn-6-bl"></a> and other teachings of the Church’s
Magisterium<a href="iPriest%20Roman%20Missal%20SE%20USA%20-%20Roman%20Missal%20ICEL_split_884.htm#fn-7"> [7]</a><a id="fn-7-bl"></a> in the same sense and
with the same doctrine as the Council of Trent proposed that it must be
believed,<a href="iPriest%20Roman%20Missal%20SE%20USA%20-%20Roman%20Missal%20ICEL_split_884.htm#fn-8"> [8]</a><a id="fn-8-bl"></a> is proclaimed in the
celebration of the Mass, not only by the very words of consecration by which
Christ is rendered present through transubstantiation, but also with a sense
and a demonstration of the greatest reverence and adoration which strives for
realization in the Eucharistic liturgy. For the same reason, the Christian
people are led to worship this wondrous Sacrament through adoration in a
special way on Thursday of the Lord’s Supper in Holy Week and on the Solemnity
of the Most Holy Body and Blood of Christ.</p>

<p class="girm">4. In truth, the nature of the ministerial Priesthood proper to
the Bishop and the Priest, who offer the Sacrifice in the person of Christ and
who preside over the gathering of the holy people, shines forth in the form of
the rite itself, on account of the more prominent place and function given to
the Priest. The essential elements of this function are set out and explained
clearly and extensively in the Preface for the Chrism Mass on Thursday of Holy
Week, the day, namely, when the institution of the Priesthood is commemorated.
For in the Preface is made clear how the conferral of Priestly power is
accomplished through the laying on of hands; and, by the listing one by one of
its duties, that power is described which is the continuation of the power of
Christ, the High Priest of the New Testament.</p>

<p class="girm">5. Moreover, by this nature of the ministerial Priesthood,
something else is put in its proper light, something certainly to be held in
great esteem, namely, the royal Priesthood of the faithful, whose spiritual
sacrifice is brought to completion through the ministry of the Bishop and the
Priests, in union with the Sacrifice of Christ, the sole Mediator.<a href="iPriest%20Roman%20Missal%20SE%20USA%20-%20Roman%20Missal%20ICEL_split_884.htm#fn-9"> [9]</a><a id="fn-9-bl"></a> For the celebration of the Eucharist
is the action of the whole Church, and in it each one should carry out solely
but totally that which pertains to him, in virtue of the place of each within
the People of God. The result of this is that greater consideration is also
given to some aspects of the celebration that have sometimes been accorded less
attention in the course of the centuries. For this people is the People of God,
purchased by Christ’s Blood, gathered together by the Lord, nourished by his
word, the people called to present to God the prayers of the entire human
family, a people that gives thanks in Christ for the mystery of salvation by
offering his Sacrifice, a people, finally, that is brought together in unity by
Communion in the Body and Blood of Christ. This people, though holy in its
origin, nevertheless grows constantly in holiness by conscious, active, and
fruitful participation in the mystery of the Eucharist.<a href="iPriest%20Roman%20Missal%20SE%20USA%20-%20Roman%20Missal%20ICEL_split_884.htm#fn-10"> [10]</a><a id="fn-10-bl"></a></p>

<h4 class="calibre5">Uninterrupted Tradition</h4>

<p class="girm">6. When it set out its instructions for the renewal of the Order
of Mass, the Second Vatican Council, using, namely, the same words as did St
Pius V in the Apostolic Constitution Quo primum, by which the Missal of Trent
was promulgated in 1570, also ordered, among other things, that a number of
rites be restored “to the original norm of the holy Fathers.”<a href="iPriest%20Roman%20Missal%20SE%20USA%20-%20Roman%20Missal%20ICEL_split_884.htm#fn-11">
[11]</a><a id="fn-11-bl"></a> From the fact that the same words are used, it
can be noted how the two Roman Missals, although four centuries have
intervened, embrace one and the same tradition. Furthermore, if the inner
elements of this tradition are reflected upon, it is also understood how
outstandingly and felicitously the older Roman Missal is brought to fulfilment
in the later one.</p>

<p class="girm">7. In truly difficult times, when the Catholic faith in the
sacrificial nature of the Mass, the ministerial Priesthood, and the real and
perpetual presence of Christ under the Eucharistic species were called into
question, St Pius V was first of all concerned with preserving the more recent
tradition, then unjustly assailed, introducing only very slight changes into
the sacred rite. In fact, the Missal of 1570 differs very little from the very
first printed edition of 1474, which in turn faithfully takes up again the
Missal used in the time of Pope Innocent III. Moreover, manuscript books in the
Vatican Library, even though they provided material for several textual
emendations, by no means made it possible to pursue inquiry into “ancient and approved
authors” further back than the liturgical commentaries of the Middle Ages.</p>

<p class="girm">8. Today, however, innumerable writings of scholars have shed
light on the “norm of the holy Fathers,” which the revisers of the Missal of St
Pius V assiduously followed. For following the first publication in 1571 of the
Sacramentary called the Gregorian, critical editions of other ancient Roman and
Ambrosian Sacramentaries were disseminated, often in printed form, as were
ancient Hispanic and Gallican liturgical books; these editions brought to light
numerous prayers of no slight spiritual value but previously unknown.</p>

<p class="girm">In the same way, traditions of the first centuries, before the
rites of East and West were formed, are now better known because of the
discovery of so many liturgical documents.</p>

<p class="girm">Furthermore, continuing progress in the study of the holy Fathers
has also shed upon the theology of the mystery of the Eucharist the light
brought by the doctrine of such illustrious Fathers of Christian antiquity as
St Irenaeus, St Ambrose, St Cyril of Jerusalem, and St John Chrysostom.</p>

<p class="girm">9. Hence, the “norm of the holy Fathers” requires not only the
preservation of what our immediate forebears have handed on to us, but also an
understanding and a more profound pondering of the Church’s entire past ages
and of all the ways in which her one faith has been expressed in forms of human
and social culture so greatly differing among themselves, indeed, as those
prevailing in the Semitic, Greek, and Latin regions. Moreover, this broader
view allows us to see how the Holy Spirit endows the People of God with a
marvelous fidelity in preserving the unalterable deposit of faith, even though
there is a very great variety of prayers and rites.</p>

<h4 class="calibre5">Accommodation to New Conditions</h4>

<p class="girm">10. Hence, the new Missal, while bearing witness to the Roman
Church’s rule of prayer (lex orandi), also safeguards the deposit of faith
handed down by the more recent Councils and marks in its turn a step of great
importance in liturgical tradition.</p>

<p class="girm">For, when the Fathers of the Second Vatican Council reaffirmed
the dogmatic pronouncements of the Council of Trent, they spoke at a far
different time in world history, and, for that reason, were able to bring
forward proposals and measures regarding pastoral life that could not have even
been foreseen four centuries earlier.</p>

<p class="girm">11. The Council of Trent had already recognised the great
catechetical usefulness contained in the celebration of Mass but was unable to
bring out all its consequences in regard to actual practice. In fact, many at
that time requested that permission be given to use the vernacular in
celebrating the Eucharistic Sacrifice. To such a request, the Council, by
reason of the circumstances of that age, judged it a matter of duty to answer
by insisting once more on the teaching of the Church as had been handed on,
according to which the Eucharistic Sacrifice is in the first place the action
of Christ himself, whose inherent efficacy is therefore unaffected by the
manner in which the faithful participate in it. The Council for this reason
stated in these firm and likewise measured words: “Although the Mass contains
much instruction for the faithful people, it did not seem to the Fathers
expedient, however, that it be celebrated indiscriminately in the vernacular.”<a href="iPriest%20Roman%20Missal%20SE%20USA%20-%20Roman%20Missal%20ICEL_split_884.htm#fn-12"> [12]</a><a id="fn-12-bl"></a> And the Council declared worthy of
censure anyone maintaining that “the rite of the Roman Church, in which part of
the Canon and the words of consecration are pronounced in a low voice, is to be
condemned, or that the Mass must be celebrated only in the vernacular.”<a href="iPriest%20Roman%20Missal%20SE%20USA%20-%20Roman%20Missal%20ICEL_split_884.htm#fn-13"> [13]</a><a id="fn-13-bl"></a> Nevertheless, at the same time as
it prohibited the use of the vernacular in the Mass, it ordered, on the other
hand, pastors of souls to put appropriate catechesis in its place: “Lest
Christ’s flock go hungry... the Holy Synod commands pastors and each and all of
those others having the care of souls that frequently during the celebration of
Mass, either personally or through others, they should explain what is read at
Mass; and expound, among other things, something of the mystery of this most
holy Sacrifice, especially on Sundays and feast days.”<a href="iPriest%20Roman%20Missal%20SE%20USA%20-%20Roman%20Missal%20ICEL_split_884.htm#fn-14"> [14]</a><a id="fn-14-bl"></a></p>

<p class="girm">12. Hence, the Second Vatican Council, having come together in
order to accommodate the Church to the requirements of her proper apostolic
office precisely in these times, considered thoroughly, as had the Council of
Trent, the catechetical and pastoral character of the Sacred Liturgy.<a href="iPriest%20Roman%20Missal%20SE%20USA%20-%20Roman%20Missal%20ICEL_split_884.htm#fn-15"> [15]</a><a id="fn-15-bl"></a> And since no Catholic would now
deny a sacred rite celebrated in Latin to be legitimate and efficacious, the
Council was also able to concede that “not rarely adopting the vernacular
language may be of great usefulness for the people” and gave permission for it
to be used.<a href="iPriest%20Roman%20Missal%20SE%20USA%20-%20Roman%20Missal%20ICEL_split_884.htm#fn-16"> [16]</a><a id="fn-16-bl"></a> The eagerness with
which this measure was everywhere received has certainly been so great that it
has led, under the guidance of the Bishops and the Apostolic See itself, to
permission for all liturgical celebrations in which the people participate to
be in the vernacular, so that the people may more fully understand the mystery
which is celebrated.</p>

<p class="girm">13. In this regard, although the use of the vernacular in the
Sacred Liturgy is a means, admittedly of great importance, for expressing more
clearly catechesis on the mystery, a catechesis inherent in the celebration
itself, the Second Vatican Council ordered additionally that certain
prescriptions of the Council of Trent that had not been followed everywhere be
brought to fruition, such as the Homily to be given on Sundays and feast days<a href="iPriest%20Roman%20Missal%20SE%20USA%20-%20Roman%20Missal%20ICEL_split_884.htm#fn-17"> [17]</a><a id="fn-17-bl"></a> and the faculty to interject
certain explanations during the sacred rites themselves.<a href="iPriest%20Roman%20Missal%20SE%20USA%20-%20Roman%20Missal%20ICEL_split_884.htm#fn-18"> [18]</a><a id="fn-18-bl"></a></p>

<p class="girm">Above all, the Second Vatican Council, which recommended “that
more perfect form of participation in the Mass by which the faithful, after the
Priest’s Communion, receive the Lord’s Body from the same Sacrifice,”<a href="iPriest%20Roman%20Missal%20SE%20USA%20-%20Roman%20Missal%20ICEL_split_884.htm#fn-19"> [19]</a><a id="fn-19-bl"></a> called for another desire of the
Fathers of Trent to be put into effect, namely, that for the sake of a fuller
participation in the Holy Eucharist “at each Mass the faithful present should
communicate not only by spiritual desire but also by sacramental reception of
the Eucharist.”<a href="iPriest%20Roman%20Missal%20SE%20USA%20-%20Roman%20Missal%20ICEL_split_884.htm#fn-20"> [20]</a><a id="fn-20-bl"></a></p>

<p class="girm">14. Prompted by the same intention and pastoral zeal, the Second
Vatican Council was able to give renewed consideration to what was established
by Trent on Communion under both kinds. And indeed, since nowadays the
doctrinal principles on the complete efficacy of Eucharistic Communion received
under the species of bread alone are not in any way called into question, the
Council gave permission for the reception on occasion of Communion under both
kinds, because this clearer form of the sacramental sign offers a particular
opportunity for understanding more deeply the mystery in which the faithful
participate.<a href="iPriest%20Roman%20Missal%20SE%20USA%20-%20Roman%20Missal%20ICEL_split_884.htm#fn-21"> [21]</a><a id="fn-21-bl"></a></p>

<p class="girm">15. In this manner the Church, while remaining faithful to her
office as teacher of truth, safeguarding “things old,” that is, the deposit of
tradition, fulfils at the same time the duty of examining and prudently
adopting “things new” (cf. Mt 13:52).</p>

<p class="girm">For part of the new Missal orders the prayers of the Church in a
way more open to the needs of our times. Of this kind are above all the Ritual
Masses and Masses for Various Needs, in which tradition and new elements are
appropriately brought together. Thus, while a great number of expressions,
drawn from the Church’s most ancient tradition and familiar through the many
editions of the Roman Missal, have remained unchanged, numerous others have
been accommodated to the needs and conditions proper to our own age, and still
others, such as the prayers for the Church, for the laity, for the
sanctification of human labour, for the community of all nations, and certain
needs proper to our era, have been newly composed, drawing on the thoughts and
often the very phrasing of the recent documents of the Council.</p>

<p class="girm">On account, moreover, of the same attitude toward the new state
of the world as it now is, it seemed to cause no harm at all to so revered a
treasure if some phrases were changed so that the language would be in accord
with that of modern theology and would truly reflect the current state of the
Church’s discipline. Hence, several expressions regarding the evaluation and
use of earthly goods have been changed, as have several which alluded to a
certain form of outward penance which was proper to other periods of the
Church’s past.</p>

<p class="girm">In this way, finally, the liturgical norms of the Council of Trent
have certainly been completed and perfected in many particulars by those of the
Second Vatican Council, which has carried into effect the efforts to bring the
faithful closer to the Sacred Liturgy that have been taken up these last four
centuries and especially those of recent times, and above all the attention to
the Liturgy promoted by St Pius X and his Successors.</p>
