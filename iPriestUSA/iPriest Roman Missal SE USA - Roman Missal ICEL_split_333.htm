<p class="calibre6"><a id="P53"></a>The Lord be with you.</p>

<p class="response">And with your spirit.</p>

<p class="calibre6">Lift up your hearts.</p>

<p class="response">We lift them up to the Lord.</p>

<p class="calibre6">Let us give thanks to the Lord our God.</p>

<p class="response">It is right and just.</p>

<p class="calibre6">It is truly right and just that we should
give you thanks and praise, O God, almighty Father, for all you do in this
world, through our Lord Jesus Christ. </p>

<p class="calibre6">For though the human race is divided by
dissension and discord, yet we know that by testing us you change our hearts to
prepare them for reconciliation. </p>

<p class="calibre6">Even more, by your Spirit you move human
hearts that enemies may speak to each other again, adversaries may join hands,
and peoples seek to meet together. </p>

<p class="calibre6">By the working of your power it comes about,
O Lord, that hatred is overcome by love, revenge gives way to forgiveness, and
discord is changed to mutual respect. </p>

<p class="calibre6">Therefore, as we give you ceaseless thanks
with the choirs of heaven, we cry out to your majesty on earth, and without end
we acclaim: </p>

<p class="all">Holy, Holy, Holy Lord God of hosts.
Heaven and earth are full of your glory. Hosanna in the highest. Blessed is he
who comes in the name of the Lord. Hosanna in the highest.</p>

<p class="rubric"><a id="EPR2"></a>The Priest,
with hands extended, says: </p>

<p class="calibre6"><img border="0" id="_x0000_i1135" src="epr2.gif" class="calibre16"/> <img border="0" id="_x0000_i1134" src="pc.gif" class="calibre12"/></p>

<p class="calibre6">You, therefore, almighty Father, <br class="wordsection"/>
we bless through Jesus Christ your Son, <br class="wordsection"/>
who comes in your name. <br class="wordsection"/>
He himself is the Word that brings salvation, <br class="wordsection"/>
the hand you extend to sinners, <br class="wordsection"/>
the way by which your peace is offered to us. <br class="wordsection"/>
When we ourselves had turned away from you <br class="wordsection"/>
on account of our sins, <br class="wordsection"/>
you brought us back to be reconciled, O Lord, <br class="wordsection"/>
so that, converted at last to you, <br class="wordsection"/>
we might love one another through your Son, <br class="wordsection"/>
whom for our sake you handed over to death. </p>

<p class="rubric">He joins his hands and, holding
them extended over the offerings, says: </p>

<p class="calibre6"><img border="0" id="_x0000_i1133" src="cc.gif" class="calibre12"/>And now,
celebrating the reconciliation <br class="wordsection"/>
Christ has brought us, <br class="wordsection"/>
we entreat you: <br class="wordsection"/>
sanctify these gifts by the outpouring of your Spirit, </p>

<p class="rubric">He joins his hands and makes the
Sign of the Cross once over the bread and chalice together, saying: </p>

<p class="calibre6">that they may become the Body and <span class="red1">+</span> Blood of your Son, <br class="wordsection"/>
whose command we fulfil <br class="wordsection"/>
when we celebrate these mysteries. </p>

<p class="rubric">He joins his hands. </p>

<p class="rubric">In the formulas that follow, the
words of the Lord should be pronounced clearly and distinctly, as the nature of these words requires. </p>

<p class="calibre6">For when about to give his life to set us
free, <br class="wordsection"/>
as he reclined at supper, </p>

<p class="rubric">He takes the bread and, holding
it slightly raised above the altar, continues: </p>

<p class="calibre6">he himself took bread into his hands, <br class="wordsection"/>
and, giving you thanks, <br class="wordsection"/>
he said the blessing, <br class="wordsection"/>
broke the bread and gave it to his disciples, saying: </p>

<p class="rubric">He bows slightly. </p>

<p class="calibre6">TAKE THIS, ALL OF YOU, AND EAT OF IT, <br class="wordsection"/>
FOR THIS IS MY BODY, WHICH WILL BE GIVEN UP FOR YOU.</p>

<p class="rubric">He shows the consecrated host to
the people, places it again on the paten, and genuflects in adoration. </p>

<p class="rubric">After this, he continues: </p>

<p class="calibre6">In a similar way, on that same evening, </p>

<p class="rubric">He takes the chalice and,
holding it slightly raised above the altar, continues: </p>

<p class="calibre6">he took the chalice of blessing in his hands,
<br class="wordsection"/>
confessing your mercy, <br class="wordsection"/>
and gave the chalice to his disciples, saying: </p>

<p class="rubric">He bows slightly. </p>

<p class="calibre6">TAKE THIS, ALL OF YOU, AND DRINK FROM IT, <br class="wordsection"/>
FOR THIS IS THE CHALICE OF MY BLOOD, <br class="wordsection"/>
THE BLOOD OF THE NEW AND ETERNAL COVENANT, <br class="wordsection"/>
WHICH WILL BE POURED OUT FOR YOU <br class="wordsection"/>
AND FOR MANY FOR THE FORGIVENESS OF SINS. </p>

<p class="calibre6">DO THIS IN MEMORY OF ME. </p>

<p class="rubric">He shows the chalice to the
people, places it on the corporal, and genuflects in adoration. </p>

<p class="rubric"><img border="0" id="_x0000_i1132" src="pc.gif" class="calibre12"/>Then
he says: </p>

<p class="calibre6">The mystery of faith. </p>

<p class="rubric">And the people continue,
acclaiming: </p>

<p class="response">We proclaim your Death, O
Lord, <br class="wordsection"/>
and profess your Resurrection until you come again. </p>

<p class="rubric">or: </p>

<p class="response">When we eat this Bread and drink
this Cup, <br class="wordsection"/>
we proclaim your Death, O Lord, until you come again. </p>

<p class="rubric">or: </p>

<p class="response">Save us, Saviour of the world,
<br class="wordsection"/>
for by your Cross and Resurrection you have set us free. </p>

<p class="rubric">Then the Priest, with hands
extended, says: </p>

<p class="calibre6"><img border="0" id="_x0000_i1131" src="cc.gif" class="calibre12"/>Celebrating,
therefore, <br class="wordsection"/>
the memorial of the Death and Resurrection of your Son, <br class="wordsection"/>
who left us this pledge of his love, <br class="wordsection"/>
we offer you what you have bestowed on us, <br class="wordsection"/>
the Sacrifice of perfect reconciliation. </p>

<p class="calibre6">Holy Father, we humbly beseech you <br class="wordsection"/>
to accept us also, together with your Son, <br class="wordsection"/>
and in this saving banquet <br class="wordsection"/>
graciously to endow us with his very Spirit, <br class="wordsection"/>
who takes away everything <br class="wordsection"/>
that estranges us from one another. </p>

<p class="calibre6"><img border="0" id="_x0000_i1130" src="c1.gif" class="calibre12"/>May he make
your Church a sign of unity and an instrument of your peace among all people
and may he keep us in communion with <span class="red1">Francis</span>
our Pope, <span class="opt">and</span> <span class="red1">N.</span> our Bishop,<span class="red1">*</span> <span class="opt">and</span> all the Bishops and your
entire people. </p>

<p class="calibre6"><img border="0" id="_x0000_i1129" src="c2.gif" class="calibre12"/>Just as you
have gathered us now at the table of your Son, so also bring us together, with
the glorious Virgin Mary, Mother of God, with your blessed Apostles and all the
Saints, with our brothers and sisters and those of every race and tongue who
have died in your friendship. Bring us to share with them the unending banquet
of unity in a new heaven and a new earth, where the fullness of your peace will
shine forth </p>

<p class="rubric">He joins his hands. </p>

<p class="calibre6">in Christ Jesus our Lord. </p>

<p class="rubric">He takes the chalice and the
paten with the host and, raising both, he says: </p>

<p class="calibre6"><img border="0" id="_x0000_i1128" src="pcc.gif" class="calibre12"/>Through
him, and with him, and in him, <br class="wordsection"/>
O God, almighty Father, <br class="wordsection"/>
in the unity of the Holy Spirit, <br class="wordsection"/>
all glory and honour is yours, <br class="wordsection"/>
for ever and ever.</p>

<p class="rubric">The people continue: </p>

<p class="response">Amen. | <a href="iPriest%20Roman%20Missal%20SE%20USA%20-%20Roman%20Missal%20ICEL_split_347.htm#CR">Then follows the Communion Rite.</a></p>
