<p class="rubric">124. After the chalice and paten
have been set down, the Priest, with hands joined, says: </p>

<p class="calibre6">At the Saviour’s command <br class="wordsection"/>
and formed by divine teaching, we dare to say: </p>

<p class="rubric">He extends his hands and,
together with the people, continues: </p>

hallowed be thy name; <br class="wordsection"/>
thy kingdom come, <br class="wordsection"/>
thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven. <br class="wordsection"/>
Give us this day our daily bread, <br class="wordsection"/>
and forgive us our trespasses, <br class="wordsection"/>
as we forgive those who trespass against us; <br class="wordsection"/>
and lead us not into temptation, <br class="wordsection"/>
but deliver us from evil. </p>

<p class="rubric">After the Our Father, the prayer
Deliver us is omitted. The Priest, standing and facing the bride and
bridegroom, invokes on them God’s blessing, which is never omitted.</p>

<p class="rubric">In the invitation, if one or
both of the spouses will not be receiving Communion, the words in parentheses
are omitted. In the prayer, the words in parentheses may be omitted if it seems
that circumstances suggest it, for example, if the bride and bridegroom are
advanced in years.</p>

<p class="rubric">The bride and bridegroom
approach the altar or, if appropriate, they remain at their place and kneel.</p>

<p class="rubric">The Priest, with hands joined,
calls upon those present to pray, saying:</p>

<p class="calibre6">Let us humbly invoke by our prayers, <br class="wordsection"/>
dear brothers and sisters, <br class="wordsection"/>
God’s blessing upon this bride and groom,<br class="wordsection"/>
that in his kindness he may favour with his help<br class="wordsection"/>
those on whom he has bestowed the Sacrament of Matrimony.</p>

<p class="rubric">All pray in silence for a while.</p>

<p class="rubric">Then the Priest, with hands
extended over the bride and bridegroom, continues:</p>

<p class="calibre6">Holy Father, maker of the whole world,<br class="wordsection"/>
who created man and woman in your own image,<br class="wordsection"/>
and willed that their union be crowned with your blessing, <br class="wordsection"/>
we humbly beseech you for these your servants,<br class="wordsection"/>
who are joined today in the Sacrament of Matrimony.</p>

<p class="calibre6">May your abundant blessing, Lord,<br class="wordsection"/>
come down upon this bride, <span class="red1">[Bride]</span>,<br class="wordsection"/>
and upon <span class="red1">[Groom]</span>, her companion for life,<br class="wordsection"/>
and may the power of your Holy Spirit<br class="wordsection"/>
set their hearts aflame from on high,<br class="wordsection"/>
so that, living out together the gift of Matrimony, <br class="wordsection"/>
they may (adorn their family with children and) <br class="wordsection"/>
enrich the Church.</p>

<p class="calibre6">In happiness may they praise you, O Lord,<br class="wordsection"/>
in sorrow may they seek you out,<br class="wordsection"/>
may they have the joy of your presence<br class="wordsection"/>
to assist them in their toil, and know that you are near<br class="wordsection"/>
to comfort them in their need;<br class="wordsection"/>
let them pray to you in the holy assembly<br class="wordsection"/>
and bear witness to you in the world,<br class="wordsection"/>
and after a happy old age,<br class="wordsection"/>
together with the circle of friends that surrounds them,<br class="wordsection"/>
may they come to the Kingdom of Heaven.</p>

<p class="response">Amen.</p>

<p class="rubric">The prayer Lord Jesus Christ is
omitted and The peace of the Lord is said immediately.</p>

the people, extending and then joining his hands, adds: </p>

<p class="rubric">The people reply: </p>

<p class="response">And with your spirit. </p>

<p class="rubric">128. Then, if appropriate, the
Deacon, or the Priest, adds: </p>

<p class="calibre6">Let us offer each other the sign of peace. </p>

<p class="rubric">Then the bride and bridegroom
and all present offer one another a sign, in keeping with local customs, that
expresses peace, communion and charity.</p>

we have offered may be felt by us all.</p>
