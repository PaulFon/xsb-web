THE PRESENTATION OF THE LORD <br class="calibre4"/>
Feast </h2>

<h3 class="calibre2">The Blessing of Candles and the Procession <br class="calibre4"/>
First Form: The Procession</h3>

<p class="rubric">At an appropriate hour, a gathering
takes place at a smaller church or other suitable place other than inside the
church to which the procession will go. The faithful hold in their hands
unlighted candles.</p>

<p class="rubric">The Priest, wearing white vestments
as for Mass, approaches with the ministers. Instead of the chasuble, the Priest
may wear a cope, which he leaves aside after the procession is over.</p>

<p class="rubric">While the candles are being lit, the
following antiphon or another appropriate chant is sung.</p>

<p class="ant">Behold, our Lord will come with power, to enlighten the eyes
of his servants, alleluia.</p>

<p class="rubric">When the chant is concluded, the
Priest, facing the people, says: </p>
<p class="calibre6">In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit. </p>
<p class="rubric">Then the Priest greets the people in the usual way, and next he gives an
introductory address, encouraging the faithful to celebrate the rite of this
feast day actively and consciously. He may use these or similar words:</p>

<p class="calibre6">Dear brethren (brothers and sisters),<br class="wordsection"/>
forty days have passed <br class="wordsection"/>
since we celebrated the joyful feast of the Nativity of the Lord.</p>

<p class="calibre6">Today is the blessed day <br class="wordsection"/>
when Jesus was presented in the Temple by Mary and Joseph. <br class="wordsection"/>
Outwardly he was fulfilling the Law,<br class="wordsection"/>
but in reality he was coming to meet his believing people. <br class="wordsection"/>
Prompted by the Holy Spirit,<br class="wordsection"/>
Simeon and Anna came to the Temple.</p>

<p class="calibre6">Enlightened by the same Spirit,<br class="wordsection"/>
they recognised the Lord<br class="wordsection"/>
and confessed him with exultation.</p>

<p class="calibre6">So let us also, gathered together by the Holy Spirit,<br class="wordsection"/>
proceed to the house of God to encounter Christ.</p>

<p class="calibre6">There we shall find him<br class="wordsection"/>
and recognise him in the breaking of the bread,<br class="wordsection"/>
until he comes again, revealed in glory.</p>

<p class="rubric">After the address the Priest blesses
the candles, saying, with hands extended: </p>

<p class="calibre6">Let us pray.</p>

<p class="calibre6">O God, source and origin of all light,<br class="wordsection"/>
who on this day showed to the just man Simeon<br class="wordsection"/>
the Light for revelation to the Gentiles,<br class="wordsection"/>
we humbly ask that,<br class="wordsection"/>
in answer to your people’s prayers,<br class="wordsection"/>
you may be pleased to sanctify with your blessing <span class="red1">+</span> these candles, <br class="wordsection"/>
which we are eager to carry in praise of your name,<br class="wordsection"/>
so that, treading the path of virtue,<br class="wordsection"/>
we may reach that light which never fails.</p>

<p class="calibre6">Through Christ our Lord.</p>

<p class="calibre6">R. Amen.</p>

<p class="rubric">Or:</p>

<p class="calibre6">O God, true light, who create light eternal, <br class="wordsection"/>
spreading it far and wide,<br class="wordsection"/>
pour, we pray, into the hearts of the faithful <br class="wordsection"/>
the brilliance of perpetual light,<br class="wordsection"/>
so that all who are brightened in your holy temple <br class="wordsection"/>
by the splendour of these candles<br class="wordsection"/>
may happily reach the light of your glory. </p>

<p class="calibre6">Through Christ our Lord.</p>

<p class="calibre6">R. Amen.</p>

<p class="rubric">He sprinkles the candles with holy
water without saying anything, and puts incense into the thurible for the
procession.</p>

<p class="rubric">Then the Priest receives from the
Deacon or a minister the lighted candle prepared for him and the procession
begins, with the Deacon announcing (or, if there is no Deacon, the Priest
himself):</p>

<p class="calibre6">Let us go in peace to meet the Lord.</p>

<p class="rubric">In this case, all respond:</p>

<p class="calibre6">Let us go forth in peace.</p>

<p class="rubric">All carry lighted candles. As the
procession moves forward, one or other of the antiphons that follow is sung,
namely the antiphon A light for revelation with the canticle (Lk 2:29-32), or
the antiphon Sion, adorn your bridal chamber or another appropriate chant.</p>

<h3 class="calibre2">I</h3>

<p class="ant">A light for revelation to the Gentiles and the glory of your people Israel.</p>

<p class="calibre6">Lord, now you let your servant go in peace, <br class="wordsection"/>
in accordance with your word.</p>

<p class="ant">A light for revelation to the Gentiles and the glory of your people Israel.</p>


<p class="calibre6">For my eyes have seen your salvation.</p>

<p class="ant">A light for revelation to the Gentiles and the glory of your people Israel.</p>


<p class="calibre6">Which you have prepared in the sight of all peoples.</p>

<p class="ant">A light for revelation to the Gentiles and the glory of your people Israel.</p>


<h3 class="calibre2">II</h3>

<p class="ant">Sion, adorn your bridal chamber and welcome Christ the King; take Mary in your arms, who is the gate of heaven, for she herself is carrying the King of glory and new light. <br class="wordsection"/>A Virgin she remains, though bringing in her hands the Son before the morning star begotten, whom Simeon, taking in his arms announced to the peoples as Lord of life and death and Saviour of the world.</p>

<p class="rubric">As the procession enters the church,
the Entrance Antiphon of the Mass is sung. When the Priest has arrived at the
altar, he venerates it and, if appropriate, incenses it. Then he goes to the
chair, where he takes off the cope, if he used it in the procession, and puts
on a chasuble. After the singing of the hymn Gloria in excelsis (Glory to God
in the highest), he says the Collect as usual. The Mass continues in the usual
manner.</p>

<h3 class="calibre2">Second Form: The Solemn Entrance</h3>

<p class="rubric">Whenever a procession cannot take
place, the faithful gather in church, holding candles in their hands. The
Priest, wearing white sacred vestments as for Mass, together with the ministers
and a representative group of the faithful, goes to a suitable place, either in
front of the church door or inside the church itself, where at least a large
part of the faithful can conveniently participate in the rite.</p>

<p class="rubric">When the Priest reaches the place
appointed for the blessing of the candles, candles are lit while the antiphon
Behold, our Lord (no. 3) or another appropriate chant is sung.</p>

<p class="rubric">Then, after the greeting and address,
the Priest blesses the candles, as above nos. 4-5; and then the procession to
the altar takes place, with singing (nos. 6-7). For Mass, what is indicated in
no. 8 above is observed.</p>
