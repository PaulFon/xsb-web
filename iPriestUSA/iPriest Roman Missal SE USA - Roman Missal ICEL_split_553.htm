<h3 class="calibre2">Preface: The glory of Jerusalem, our mother.</h3>

<p class="calibre6">The Lord be with you.</p>

<p class="response">And with your spirit.</p>

<p class="calibre6">Lift up your hearts.</p>

<p class="response">We lift them up to the Lord.</p>

<p class="calibre6">Let us give thanks to the Lord our God.</p>

<p class="response">It is right and just.</p>

<p class="calibre6">It is truly right and just, our duty and our
salvation, always and everywhere to give you thanks, Lord, holy Father,
almighty and eternal God.</p>

<p class="calibre6">For today by your gift we celebrate the
festival of your city, the heavenly Jerusalem, our mother, where the great
array of our brothers and sisters already gives you eternal praise.</p>

<p class="calibre6">Towards her, we eagerly hasten, as pilgrims
advancing by faith, rejoicing in the glory bestowed upon those exalted members of
the Church through whom you give us, in our frailty, both strength and good
example.</p>

<p class="calibre6">And so, we glorify you with the multitude of
Saints and Angels, as with one voice of praise we acclaim:</p>

<p class="all">Holy, Holy, Holy Lord God of hosts.
Heaven and earth are full of your glory. Hosanna in the highest. Blessed is he
who comes in the name of the Lord. Hosanna in the highest.</p>

<p class="ant">Blessed are the clean of heart, for
they shall see God. Blessed are the peacemakers, for they shall be called
children of God. Blessed are they who are persecuted for the sake of
righteousness, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.</p>

<h3 class="calibre2">Prayer after Communion</h3>

<p class="calibre6">As we adore you, O God, who alone are holy
and wonderful in all your Saints, we implore your grace, so that, coming to
perfect holiness in the fullness of your love, we may pass from this pilgrim
table to the banquet of our heavenly homeland.</p>
