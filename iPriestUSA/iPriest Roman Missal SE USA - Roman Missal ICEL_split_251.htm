<p class="calibre6">The Lord be with you.</p>

<p class="response">And with your spirit.</p>

<p class="calibre6">Lift up your hearts.</p>

<p class="response">We lift them up to the Lord.</p>

<p class="calibre6">Let us give thanks to the Lord our God.</p>

<p class="response">It is right and just.</p>

<p class="calibre6">It is truly right and just, our duty and our salvation, always and everywhere to give you thanks, Lord, holy Father, almighty and eternal God, 
through Christ our Lord.</p>

<p class="calibre6">For raised up high on the Cross, 
he gave himself up for us with a wonderful love 
and poured out blood and water from his pierced side, 
the wellspring of the Church’s Sacraments, 
so that, won over to the open heart of the Saviour, all might draw water joyfully from the springs of salvation.</p>

<p class="calibre6">And so, with all the Angels and Saints, 
we praise you, as without end we acclaim:</p>

<p class="all">Holy, Holy, Holy Lord God of hosts.
Heaven and earth are full of your glory. Hosanna in the highest. Blessed is he
who comes in the name of the Lord. Hosanna in the highest.</p>

with a lance, and at once there came forth blood and water.</p>

<h3 class="calibre2">Prayer after Communion</h3>

<p class="calibre6">May this sacrament of charity, O Lord, <br class="wordsection"/>
make us fervent with the fire of holy love, <br class="wordsection"/>

we may learn to see him in our neighbour. </p>
