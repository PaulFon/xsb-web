<h3 class="calibre2">The mystery of salvation in Christ</h3>

<p class="rubric">77. The following Preface is
said in Masses that have no proper Preface, and for which a Preface related to
a specific liturgical time is not indicated.</p>

<p class="calibre6">The Lord be with you.</p>

<p class="response">And with your spirit.</p>

<p class="calibre6">Lift up your hearts.</p>

<p class="response">We lift them up to the Lord.</p>

<p class="calibre6">Let us give thanks to the Lord our God.</p>

<p class="response">It is right and just.</p>

<p class="calibre6">It is truly right and just, our duty and our
salvation, always and everywhere to give you thanks, Father most holy, through
your beloved Son, Jesus Christ, your Word through whom you made all things,
whom you sent as our Saviour and Redeemer, incarnate by the Holy Spirit and
born of the Virgin. </p>

<p class="calibre6">Fulfilling your will and gaining for you a
holy people, he stretched out his hands as he endured his Passion, so as to
break the bonds of death and manifest the resurrection. </p>

<p class="calibre6">And so, with the Angels and all the Saints,
we declare your glory, as with one voice we acclaim: </p>

<p class="all">Holy, Holy, Holy Lord God of hosts.
Heaven and earth are full of your glory. Hosanna in the highest. Blessed is he
who comes in the name of the Lord. Hosanna in the highest.</p>
