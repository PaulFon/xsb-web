you and bless you.</p>

and set as a wise and faithful servant<br class="wordsection"/>
in charge of your household<br class="wordsection"/>
to watch like a father over your Only Begotten Son,<br class="wordsection"/>
who was conceived by the overshadowing of the Holy Spirit, <br class="wordsection"/>
our Lord Jesus Christ.</p>

Heaven and earth are full of your glory. Hosanna in the highest. Blessed is he
who comes in the name of the Lord. Hosanna in the highest.</p>
