  <p>O God, who by the Immaculate Conception of the Blessed<br>

Virgin prepared a worthy dwelling for your Son, grant, we pray, that, as<br>

you preserved her from every stain by virtue of the Death of your Son,<br>

which you foresaw, so, through her intercession, we, too, may be<br>

cleansed and admitted to your presence. Through our Lord Jesus<br>

Christ, your Son, who lives and reigns with you in the unity of the Holy<br>

Spirit, God, for ever and ever. R. Amen.</p>
