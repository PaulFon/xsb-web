  <p>Elijah went a day’s journey into the desert,<br>

until he came to a broom tree and sat beneath it. <br>

He prayed for death saying:<br>

“This is enough, O LORD! <br>

Take my life, for I am no better than my fathers.” <br>

He lay down and fell asleep under the broom tree,<br>

but then an angel touched him and ordered him to get up and eat. <br>

Elijah looked and there at his head was a hearth cake<br>

and a jug of water. <br>

After he ate and drank, he lay down again,<br>

but the angel of the LORD came back a second time,<br>

touched him, and ordered,<br>

“Get up and eat, else the journey will be too long for you!” <br>

He got up, ate, and drank;<br>

then strengthened by that food,<br>

he walked forty days and forty nights to the mountain of God, Horeb.</p>
