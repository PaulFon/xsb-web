  <p>Let us pray. Grant, we pray, almighty God, <br>

that, always pondering spiritual things, <br>

we may carry out in both word and deed <br>

that which is pleasing to you. <br>

Through our Lord Jesus Christ, your Son, <br>

who lives and reigns with you in the unity of the Holy Spirit, <br>

God, for ever and ever. R. Amen.</p>
