  <p>A reading from the book of Isaiah<br>

Rise up in splendor, Jerusalem!  Your light has come,<br>

the glory of the Lord shines upon you.<br>

See, darkness covers the earth,<br>

and thick clouds cover the peoples;<br>

but upon you the LORD shines,<br>

and over you appears his glory.<br>

Nations shall walk by your light,<br>

and kings by your shining radiance.<br>

Raise your eyes and look about;<br>

they all gather and come to you:<br>

your sons come from afar,<br>

and your daughters in the arms of their nurses.<br>

<br>

Then you shall be radiant at what you see,<br>

your heart shall throb and overflow,<br>

for the riches of the sea shall be emptied out before you,<br>

the wealth of nations shall be brought to you.<br>

Caravans of camels shall fill you,<br>

dromedaries from Midian and Ephah;<br>

all from Sheba shall come<br>

bearing gold and frankincense,<br>

and proclaiming the praises of the LORD.</p>
