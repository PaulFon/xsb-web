  <p>O God, who through your Word <br>
reconcile the human race to yourself in a wonderful way, <br>
grant, we pray, <br>
that with prompt devotion and eager faith <br>
the Christian people may hasten <br>
toward the solemn celebrations to come. <br>
Through our Lord Jesus Christ, your Son, <br>
who lives and reigns with you in the unity of the Holy Spirit,<br>
God, for ever and ever. R. Amen.</p>
