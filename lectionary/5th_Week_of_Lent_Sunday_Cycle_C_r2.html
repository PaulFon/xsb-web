  <p>A reading from the letter of St. Paul<br>

to the Philippians<br>

Brothers and sisters:<br>

I consider everything as a loss<br>

because of the supreme good of knowing Christ Jesus my Lord.<br>

For his sake I have accepted the loss of all things<br>

and I consider them so much rubbish,<br>

that I may gain Christ and be found in him,<br>

not having any righteousness of my own based on the law<br>

but that which comes through faith in Christ,<br>

the righteousness from God,<br>

depending on faith to know him and the power of his resurrection<br>

and the sharing of his sufferings by being conformed to his death,<br>

if somehow I may attain the resurrection from the dead.<br>

<br>

It is not that I have already taken hold of it<br>

or have already attained perfect maturity,<br>

but I continue my pursuit in hope that I may possess it,<br>

since I have indeed been taken possession of by Christ Jesus.<br>

Brothers and sisters, I for my part<br>

do not consider myself to have taken possession.<br>

Just one thing: forgetting what lies behind<br>

but straining forward to what lies ahead,<br>

I continue my pursuit toward the goal,<br>

the prize of God’s upward calling, in Christ Jesus.</p>
