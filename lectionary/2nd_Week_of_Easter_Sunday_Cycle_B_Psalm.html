  <p>R. Give Thanks to the Lord, for He is Good, His Love is Everlasting. Or: R. Alleluia. Let the house of Israel say, His mercy endures forever. Let the house of Aaron say, His mercy endures forever. Let those who fear the Lord say, His mercy endures forever. R. Give thanks to the Lord, for he is good, his love is everlasting. Or: R. Alleluia. I was hard pressed and was falling, but the Lord helped me. My strength and my courage is the Lord, and he has been my savior. The joyful shout of victory in the tents of the just:  R. Give thanks to the Lord, for he is good, his love is everlasting. Or: R. Alleluia. The stone which the builders rejected has become the cornerstone. By the Lord has this been done; it is wonderful in our eyes. This is the day the Lord has made; let us be glad and rejoice in it. R. Give thanks to the Lord, for he is good, his love is everlasting. Or: R. Alleluia.</p>
