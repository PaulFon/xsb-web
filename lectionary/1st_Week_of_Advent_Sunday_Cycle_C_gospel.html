  <p>A reading from the holy Gospel according to Luke. R. Glory to you, O Lord. <br>

Jesus said to his disciples:<br>

“There will be signs in the sun, the moon, and the stars, <br>

and on earth nations will be in dismay, <br>

perplexed by the roaring of the sea and the waves.<br>

People will die of fright <br>

in anticipation of what is coming upon the world, <br>

for the powers of the heavens will be shaken.<br>

And then they will see the Son of Man <br>

coming in a cloud with power and great glory.<br>

But when these signs begin to happen, <br>

stand erect and raise your heads <br>

because your redemption is at hand.<br>

<br>

“Beware that your hearts do not become drowsy <br>

from carousing and drunkenness <br>

and the anxieties of daily life, <br>

and that day catch you by surprise like a trap.<br>

For that day will assault everyone<br>

who lives on the face of the earth.<br>

Be vigilant at all times <br>

and pray that you have the strength <br>

to escape the tribulations that are imminent <br>

and to stand before the Son of Man.”</p>
