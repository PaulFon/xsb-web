  <p>O God, who see how your people faithfully await the feast of<br>

the Lord's Nativity, enable us, we pray, to attain the joys of so great a<br>

salvation and to celebrate them always with solemn worship and glad<br>

rejoicing. Through our Lord Jesus Christ, your Son, who lives and<br>

reigns with you in the unity of the Holy Spirit, God, for ever and ever. R.<br>

Amen.</p>
