  <p>A reading from the Letter of Saint Paul to the Hebrews:<br>

Brothers and sisters:<br>

When Christ came into the world, he said:<br>

    “Sacrifice and offering you did not desire,<br>

        but a body you prepared for me;<br>

    in holocausts and sin offerings you took no delight.<br>

    Then I said, ‘As is written of me in the scroll,<br>

    behold, I come to do your will, O God.’“<br>

<br>

First he says, “Sacrifices and offerings,<br>

holocausts and sin offerings, <br>

you neither desired nor delighted in.”<br>

These are offered according to the law.<br>

Then he says, :Behold, I come to do your will.”<br>

He takes away the first to establish the second.<br>

By this “will,”  we have been consecrated <br>

through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once for all.</p>
