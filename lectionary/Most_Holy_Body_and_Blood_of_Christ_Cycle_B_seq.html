  <p>Laud, O Zion, your salvation,<br>

Laud with hymns of exultation,<br>

Christ, your king and shepherd true:<br>

<br>

Bring him all the praise you know,<br>

He is more than you bestow.<br>

Never can you reach his due.<br>

<br>

Special theme for glad thanksgiving<br>

Is the quick'ning and the living<br>

Bread today before you set:<br>

<br>

From his hands of old partaken,<br>

As we know, by faith unshaken,<br>

Where the Twelve at supper met.<br>

<br>

Full and clear ring out your chanting,<br>

Joy nor sweetest grace be wanting,<br>

From your heart let praises burst:<br>

<br>

For today the feast is holden,<br>

When the institution olden<br>

Of that supper was rehearsed.<br>

<br>

Here the new law's new oblation,<br>

By the new king's revelation,<br>

Ends the form of ancient rite:<br>

<br>

Now the new the old effaces,<br>

Truth away the shadow chases,<br>

Light dispels the gloom of night.<br>

<br>

What he did at supper seated,<br>

Christ ordained to be repeated,<br>

His memorial ne'er to cease:<br>

<br>

And his rule for guidance taking,<br>

Bread and wine we hallow, making<br>

Thus our sacrifice of peace.<br>

<br>

This the truth each Christian learns,<br>

Bread into his flesh he turns,<br>

To his precious blood the wine:<br>

<br>

Sight has fail'd, nor thought conceives,<br>

But a dauntless faith believes,<br>

Resting on a pow'r divine.<br>

<br>

Here beneath these signs are hidden<br>

Priceless things to sense forbidden;<br>

Signs, not things are all we see:<br>

<br>

Blood is poured and flesh is broken,<br>

Yet in either wondrous token<br>

Christ entire we know to be.<br>

<br>

Whoso of this food partakes,<br>

Does not rend the Lord nor breaks;<br>

Christ is whole to all that taste:<br>

<br>

Thousands are, as one, receivers,<br>

One, as thousands of believers,<br>

Eats of him who cannot waste.<br>

<br>

Bad and good the feast are sharing,<br>

Of what divers dooms preparing,<br>

Endless death, or endless life.<br>

<br>

Life to these, to those damnation,<br>

See how like participation<br>

Is with unlike issues rife.<br>

<br>

When the sacrament is broken,<br>

Doubt not, but believe 'tis spoken,<br>

That each sever'd outward token<br>

doth the very whole contain.<br>

<br>

Nought the precious gift divides,<br>

Breaking but the sign betides<br>

Jesus still the same abides,<br>

still unbroken does remain.<br>

<br>

The shorter form of the sequence begins here.<br>

<br>

Lo! the angel's food is given<br>

To the pilgrim who has striven;<br>

see the children's bread from heaven,<br>

which on dogs may not be spent.<br>

<br>

Truth the ancient types fulfilling,<br>

Isaac bound, a victim willing,<br>

Paschal lamb, its lifeblood spilling,<br>

manna to the fathers sent.<br>

<br>

Very bread, good shepherd, tend us,<br>

Jesu, of your love befriend us,<br>

You refresh us, you defend us,<br>

Your eternal goodness send us<br>

In the land of life to see.<br>

<br>

You who all things can and know,<br>

Who on earth such food bestow,<br>

Grant us with your saints, though lowest,<br>

Where the heav'nly feast you show,<br>

Fellow heirs and guests to be. Amen. Alleluia.</p>
