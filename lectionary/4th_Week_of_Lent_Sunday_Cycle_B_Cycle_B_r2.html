  <p>A reading from the Letter of Saint Paul to the Ephesians: Brothers and sisters: God, who is rich in mercy,  because of the great love he had for us,  even when we were dead in our transgressions, brought us to life with Christ —by grace you have been saved —, raised us up with him,  and seated us with him in the heavens in Christ Jesus,  that in the ages to come He might show the immeasurable riches of his grace  in his kindness to us in Christ Jesus. For by grace you have been saved through faith, and this is not from you; it is the gift of God; it is not from works, so no one may boast. For we are his handiwork, created in Christ Jesus for the good works  that God has prepared in advance, that we should live in them.—The word of the Lord. R. Thanks be to God.</p>
