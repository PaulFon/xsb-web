  <p>O God, who provide gifts to be offered to your name <br>

and count our oblations as signs <br>

of our desire to serve you with devotion, <br>

we ask of your mercy <br>

that what you grant as the source of merit <br>

may also help us to attain merit's reward. <br>

Through Christ our Lord. R. Amen.<br>
