  <p>A reading from the book of Joshua <br>

The LORD said to Joshua,<br>

“Today I have removed the reproach of Egypt from you.”<br>

<br>

While the Israelites were encamped at Gilgal on the plains of Jericho,<br>

they celebrated the Passover<br>

on the evening of the fourteenth of the month.<br>

On the day after the Passover,<br>

they ate of the produce of the land<br>

in the form of unleavened cakes and parched grain.<br>

On that same day after the Passover,<br>

on which they ate of the produce of the land, the manna ceased.<br>

No longer was there manna for the Israelites,<br>

who that year ate of the yield of the land of Canaan.</p>
