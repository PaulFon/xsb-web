  <p>R. Lord, You Have the Words of Everlasting Life. <br>
The law of the Lord is perfect, <br>
refreshing the soul; <br>
The decree of the Lord is trustworthy, <br>
giving wisdom to the simple. <br>
R. Lord, you have the words of everlasting life. <br>
<br>
The precepts of the Lord are right, <br>
rejoicing the heart; the command of the Lord is clear, <br>
enlightening the eye. <br>
R. Lord, you have the words of everlasting life. <br>
<br>
The fear of the Lord is pure, <br>
enduring forever; <br>
the ordinances of the Lord are true, <br>
all of them just. <br>
R. Lord, you have the words of everlasting life. <br>
<br>
They are more precious than gold, <br>
than a heap of purest gold; <br>
sweeter also than syrup <br>
or honey from the comb. <br>
R. Lord, you have the words of everlasting life.</p>
