  <p>A reading from the Letter of Saint Paul to the Philippians:<br>

Brothers and sisters:<br>

I pray always with joy in my every prayer for all of you, <br>

because of your partnership for the gospel <br>

from the first day until now.<br>

I am confident of this,<br>

that the one who began a good work in you<br>

will continue to complete it <br>

until the day of Christ Jesus.<br>

God is my witness, <br>

how I long for all of you with the affection of Christ Jesus.<br>

And this is my prayer:<br>

that your love may increase ever more and more <br>

in knowledge and every kind of perception, <br>

to discern what is of value, <br>

so that you may be pure and blameless for the day of Christ, <br>

filled with the fruit of righteousness <br>

that comes through Jesus Christ <br>

for the glory and praise of God.</p>
