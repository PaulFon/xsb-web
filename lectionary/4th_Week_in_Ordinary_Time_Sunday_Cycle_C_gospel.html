  <p>A reading from the holy Gospel according to Luke. R. Glory to you, O Lord.<br>

Jesus began speaking in the synagogue, saying:<br>

“Today this Scripture passage is fulfilled in your hearing.”<br>

And all spoke highly of him<br>

and were amazed at the gracious words that came from his mouth. <br>

They also asked, “Isn’t this the son of Joseph?”<br>

He said to them, “Surely you will quote me this proverb,<br>

‘Physician, cure yourself,’ and say,<br>

‘Do here in your native place<br>

the things that we heard were done in Capernaum.’”<br>

And he said, “Amen, I say to you,<br>

no prophet is accepted in his own native place.<br>

Indeed, I tell you,<br>

there were many widows in Israel in the days of Elijah<br>

when the sky was closed for three and a half years<br>

and a severe famine spread over the entire land.<br>

It was to none of these that Elijah was sent,<br>

but only to a widow in Zarephath in the land of Sidon.<br>

Again, there were many lepers in Israel<br>

during the time of Elisha the prophet;<br>

yet not one of them was cleansed, but only Naaman the Syrian.”<br>

When the people in the synagogue heard this,<br>

they were all filled with fury.<br>

They rose up, drove him out of the town,<br>

and led him to the brow of the hill<br>

on which their town had been built,<br>

to hurl him down headlong.<br>

But Jesus passed through the midst of them and went away.</p>
