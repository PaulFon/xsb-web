  <p>A reading from the Letter of Saint Paul to Titus:<br>

Beloved:<br>

When the kindness and generous love <br>

of God our savior appeared,<br>

<br>

not because of any righteous deeds we had done<br>

but because of his mercy,<br>

He saved us through the bath of rebirth<br>

and renewal by the Holy Spirit,<br>

whom he richly poured out on us<br>

through Jesus Christ our savior,<br>

so that we might be justified by his grace<br>

and become heirs in hope of eternal life.</p>
