  <p>A reading from the holy Gospel according to Luke. <br>

R. Glory to you, O Lord. <br>

Jesus told his disciples a parable,<br>

"Can a blind person guide a blind person?<br>

Will not both fall into a pit?<br>

No disciple is superior to the teacher;<br>

but when fully trained,<br>

every disciple will be like his teacher.<br>

Why do you notice the splinter in your brother’s eye,<br>

but do not perceive the wooden beam in your own?<br>

How can you say to your brother,<br>

‘Brother, let me remove that splinter in your eye,’<br>

when you do not even notice the wooden beam in your own eye?<br>

You hypocrite!  Remove the wooden beam from your eye first;<br>

then you will see clearly<br>

to remove the splinter in your brother’s eye.<br>

"A good tree does not bear rotten fruit,<br>

nor does a rotten tree bear good fruit.<br>

For every tree is known by its own fruit.<br>

For people do not pick figs from thornbushes,<br>

nor do they gather grapes from brambles.<br>

A good person out of the store of goodness in his heart produces good,<br>

but an evil person out of a store of evil produces evil;<br>

for from the fullness of the heart the mouth speaks."</p>
