<div class="poetry">
<p>R. (see 9d) <strong>God upholds his city for ever.</strong><br />
Great is the LORD and wholly to be praised<br />
in the city of our God.<br />
His holy mountain, fairest of heights,<br />
is the joy of all the earth.<br />
R. <strong>God upholds his city for ever.</strong><br />
Mount Zion, “the recesses of the North,”<br />
is the city of the great King.<br />
God is with her castles;<br />
renowned is he as a stronghold.<br />
R. <strong>God upholds his city for ever.</strong><br />
For lo! the kings assemble,<br />
they come on together;<br />
They also see, and at once are stunned,<br />
terrified, routed.<br />
R. <strong>God upholds his city for ever.</strong><br />
Quaking seizes them there;<br />
anguish, like a woman’s in labor,<br />
As though a wind from the east<br />
were shattering ships of Tarshish.<br />
R. <strong>God upholds his city for ever.</strong></p>
