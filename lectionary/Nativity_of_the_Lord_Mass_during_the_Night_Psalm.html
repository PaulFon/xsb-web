  <p>R. Today is born our Savior, Christ the Lord.<br>

Sing to the LORD a new song;<br>

   sing to the LORD, all you lands.<br>

Sing to the LORD; bless his name.<br>

R. Today is born our Savior, Christ the Lord.<br>

Announce his salvation, day after day.<br>

    Tell his glory among the nations;<br>

    among all peoples, his wondrous deeds.<br>

R. Today is born our Savior, Christ the Lord.<br>

Let the heavens be glad and the earth rejoice;<br>

   let the sea and what fills it resound;<br>

   let the plains be joyful and all that is in them!<br>

Then shall all the trees of the forest exult.<br>

R. Today is born our Savior, Christ the Lord.<br>

They shall exult before the LORD, for he comes;<br>

   for he comes to rule the earth.<br>

He shall rule the world with justice<br>

   and the peoples with his constancy.<br>

R. Today is born our Savior, Christ the Lord.</p>
