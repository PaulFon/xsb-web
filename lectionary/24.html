<p>Lectionary: 24</p>      
<h3 class="name">Reading I</h3>
    <div class="SourceAddress">                                                                 
    <a href="file:///Macintosh HD/Users/paulfontaine/Downloads/deuteronomy/26﹖4.html">Dt 26:4-10</a></div>
    <p id="R1text">Moses spoke to the people, saying:<br />
“The priest shall receive the basket from you<br />
and shall set it in front of the altar of the LORD, your God.<br />
Then you shall declare before the Lord, your God,<br />
‘My father was a wandering Aramean<br />
who went down to Egypt with a small household<br />
and lived there as an alien.<br />
But there he became a nation<br />
great, strong, and numerous.<br />
When the Egyptians maltreated and oppressed us,<br />
imposing hard labor upon us,<br />
we cried to the LORD, the God of our fathers,<br />
and he heard our cry<br />
and saw our affliction, our toil, and our oppression.<br />
He brought us out of Egypt<br />
with his strong hand and outstretched arm,<br />
with terrifying power, with signs and wonders;<br />
and bringing us into this country,<br />
he gave us this land flowing with milk and honey.<br />
Therefore, I have now brought you the firstfruits<br />
of the products of the soil<br />
which you, O LORD, have given me.’<br />
And having set them before the LORD, your God,<br />
you shall bow down in his presence.”</p>

 <p id="psalmText"><span><span>R. (cf. 15b) <strong> Be with me, Lord, when I am in trouble.</strong><br />
You who dwell in the shelter of the Most High,<br />
who abide in the shadow of the Almighty,<br />
say to the LORD, “My refuge and fortress,<br />
my God in whom I trust.”<br />
R. <strong>Be with me, Lord, when I am in trouble.</strong><br />
No evil shall befall you,<br />
            nor shall affliction come near your tent,<br />
For to his angels he has given command about you,<br />
            that they guard you in all your ways.<br />
R. <strong>Be with me, Lord, when I am in trouble.</strong><br />
Upon their hands they shall bear you up,<br />
            lest you dash your foot against a stone.<br />
You shall tread upon the asp and the viper;<br />
            you shall trample down the lion and the dragon.<br />
R. <strong>Be with me, Lord, when I am in trouble.</strong><br />
Because he clings to me, I will deliver him;<br />
            I will set him on high because he acknowledges my name.<br />
He shall call upon me, and I will answer him;<br />
            I will be with him in distress;<br />
I will deliver him and glorify him.<br />
R. <strong>Be with me, Lord, when I am in trouble.</strong></span></span></p>

<h3 class="name">Reading II</h3>
<div class="SourceAddress">
               <a href="file:///Macintosh HD/Users/paulfontaine/Downloads/romans/10﹖8.html">Rom 10:8-13</a>

                <p id="r2Text"><span><span>Brothers and sisters:<br />
What does Scripture say?<br />
            <em>The word is near you,</em><br />
                        <em>in your mouth and in your heart</em><br />
—that is, the word of faith that we preach—,<br />
for, if you confess with your mouth that Jesus is Lord<br />
and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead,<br />
you will be saved.<br />
For one believes with the heart and so is justified,<br />
and one confesses with the mouth and so is saved.<br />
For the Scripture says,<br />
            <em>No one who believes in him will be put to shame.</em><br />
For there is no distinction between Jew and Greek;<br />
the same Lord is Lord of all,<br />
enriching all who call upon him.<br />
For “everyone who calls on the name of the Lord will be saved.”</span></span></p>

 <h3 class="name">Gospel</h3>
                <div class="SourceAddress">
                     <a href="file:///Macintosh HD/Users/paulfontaine/Downloads/luke/4﹖1.html">Lk 4:1-13</a>
              <div class="content-body">
                <p id="gospelText"><span><span>Filled with the Holy Spirit, Jesus returned from the Jordan<br />
and was led by the Spirit into the desert for forty days,<br />
to be tempted by the devil.<br />
He ate nothing during those days,<br />
and when they were over he was hungry.<br />
The devil said to him,<br />
“If you are the Son of God,<br />
command this stone to become bread.”<br />
Jesus answered him,<br />
“It is written, <em>One does not live on bread alone</em>.”<br />
Then he took him up and showed him<br />
all the kingdoms of the world in a single instant.<br />
The devil said to him,<br />
“I shall give to you all this power and glory;<br />
for it has been handed over to me,<br />
and I may give it to whomever I wish.<br />
All this will be yours, if you worship me.”<br />
Jesus said to him in reply,<br />
“It is written<br />
<em>You shall worship the Lord, your God,</em><br />
 <em>and him alone shall you serve.</em>”<br />
Then he led him to Jerusalem,<br />
made him stand on the parapet of the temple, and said to him,<br />
“If you are the Son of God,<br />
throw yourself down from here, for it is written:<br />
<em>He will command his angels concerning you, to guard you</em>,<br />
 and:<br />
            <em>With their hands they will support you,</em><br />
            <em>lest you dash your foot against a stone.</em>”<br />
Jesus said to him in reply,<br />
“It also says,<br />
            <em>You shall not put the Lord, your God, to the test.</em>”<br />
When the devil had finished every temptation,<br />
he departed from him for a time.</span></span></p>
