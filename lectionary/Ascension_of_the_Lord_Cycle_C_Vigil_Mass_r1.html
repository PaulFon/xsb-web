  <p>A reading from the book of Acts<br>

In the first book, Theophilus,<br>

I dealt with all that Jesus did and taught<br>

until the day he was taken up,<br>

after giving instructions through the Holy Spirit<br>

to the apostles whom he had chosen.<br>

He presented himself alive to them<br>

by many proofs after he had suffered,<br>

appearing to them during forty days<br>

and speaking about the kingdom of God.<br>

While meeting with them,<br>

he enjoined them not to depart from Jerusalem,<br>

but to wait for “the promise of the Father<br>

about which you have heard me speak;<br>

for John baptized with water,<br>

but in a few days you will be baptized with the Holy Spirit.”<br>

<br>

When they had gathered together they asked him,<br>

“Lord, are you at this time going to restore the kingdom to Israel?”<br>

He answered them, “It is not for you to know the times or seasons<br>

that the Father has established by his own authority.<br>

But you will receive power when the Holy Spirit comes upon you,<br>

and you will be my witnesses in Jerusalem,<br>

throughout Judea and Samaria,<br>

and to the ends of the earth.”<br>

When he had said this, as they were looking on,<br>

he was lifted up, and a cloud took him from their sight.<br>

While they were looking intently at the sky as he was going,<br>

suddenly two men dressed in white garments stood beside them.<br>

They said, “Men of Galilee,<br>

why are you standing there looking at the sky?<br>

This Jesus who has been taken up from you into heaven<br>

will return in the same way as you have seen him going into heaven.”</p>
