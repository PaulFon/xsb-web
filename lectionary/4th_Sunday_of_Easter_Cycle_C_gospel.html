  <p>A Reading from the Gospel according to John<br>

Jesus said:<br>

“My sheep hear my voice;<br>

I know them, and they follow me.<br>

I give them eternal life, and they shall never perish.<br>

No one can take them out of my hand.<br>

My Father, who has given them to me, is greater than all,<br>

and no one can take them out of the Father’s hand.<br>

The Father and I are one.”</p>
