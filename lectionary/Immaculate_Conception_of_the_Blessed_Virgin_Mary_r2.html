  <p>A reading from the Letter of Saint Paul to the Ephesians:<br>

Brothers and sisters:<br>

Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ,<br>

who has blessed us in Christ<br>

with every spiritual blessing in the heavens,<br>

as he chose us in him, before the foundation of the world,<br>

to be holy and without blemish before him. <br>

In love he destined us for adoption to himself through Jesus Christ,<br>

in accord with the favor of his will,<br>

for the praise of the glory of his grace<br>

that he granted us in the beloved.<br>

<br>

In him we were also chosen,<br>

destined in accord with the purpose of the One<br>

who accomplishes all things according to the intention of his will,<br>

so that we might exist for the praise of his glory,<br>

we who first hoped in Christ.</p>
