  <p>A reading from the Letter of Saint Paul to the Hebrews: <br>

Brothers and sisters:<br>

Every high priest is taken from among men<br>

and made their representative before God,<br>

to offer gifts and sacrifices for sins.<br>

He is able to deal patiently with the ignorant and erring,<br>

for he himself is beset by weakness<br>

and so, for this reason, must make sin offerings for himself<br>

as well as for the people.<br>

No one takes this honor upon himself<br>

but only when called by God,<br>

just as Aaron was.<br>

In the same way,<br>

it was not Christ who glorified himself in becoming high priest,<br>

but rather the one who said to him:<br>

    You are my son:<br>

        this day I have begotten you;<br>

just as he says in another place:<br>

    You are a priest forever<br>

        according to the order of Melchizedek.</p>
