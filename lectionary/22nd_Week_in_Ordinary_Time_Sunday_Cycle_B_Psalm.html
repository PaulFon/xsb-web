  <p>R. (1a)    The one who does justice will live in the presence of the Lord.<br>

Whoever walks blamelessly and does justice;<br>

    who thinks the truth in his heart<br>

    and slanders not with his tongue.<br>

R. The one who does justice will live in the presence of the Lord.<br>

Who harms not his fellow man,<br>

    nor takes up a reproach against his neighbor;<br>

by whom the reprobate is despised,<br>

    while he honors those who fear the LORD.<br>

R. The one who does justice will live in the presence of the Lord.<br>

Who lends not his money at usury<br>

    and accepts no bribe against the innocent.<br>

Whoever does these things<br>

    shall never be disturbed.<br>

R. The one who does justice will live in the presence of the Lord.</p>
