  <p>R. In the sight of the angels I will sing your praises, Lord.<br>

I will give thanks to you, O LORD, with all my heart,<br>

for you have heard the words of my mouth;<br>

in the presence of the angels I will sing your praise;<br>

I will worship at your holy temple<br>

and give thanks to your name.<br>

R. In the sight of the angels I will sing your praises, Lord.<br>

Because of your kindness and your truth;<br>

for you have made great above all things<br>

your name and your promise.<br>

When I called, you answered me;<br>

you built up strength within me.<br>

R. In the sight of the angels I will sing your praises, Lord.<br>

All the kings of the earth shall give thanks to you, O LORD,<br>

when they hear the words of your mouth;<br>

and they shall sing of the ways of the LORD:<br>

“Great is the glory of the LORD.”<br>

Your right hand saves me.<br>

The LORD will complete what he has done for me;<br>

your kindness, O LORD, endures forever;<br>

forsake not the work of your hands.<br>
