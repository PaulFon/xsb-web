  <p>Tax collectors and sinners were all drawing near to listen to Jesus,<br>

but the Pharisees and scribes began to complain, saying,<br>

“This man welcomes sinners and eats with them.”<br>

So to them Jesus addressed this parable:<br>

“A man had two sons, and the younger son said to his father,<br>

‘Father give me the share of your estate that should come to me.’<br>

So the father divided the property between them.<br>

After a few days, the younger son collected all his belongings<br>

and set off to a distant country<br>

where he squandered his inheritance on a life of dissipation.<br>

When he had freely spent everything,<br>

a severe famine struck that country,<br>

and he found himself in dire need.<br>

So he hired himself out to one of the local citizens<br>

who sent him to his farm to tend the swine.<br>

And he longed to eat his fill of the pods on which the swine fed,<br>

but nobody gave him any.<br>

Coming to his senses he thought,<br>

‘How many of my father’s hired workers<br>

have more than enough food to eat,<br>

but here am I, dying from hunger.<br>

I shall get up and go to my father and I shall say to him,<br>

“Father, I have sinned against heaven and against you.<br>

I no longer deserve to be called your son;<br>

treat me as you would treat one of your hired workers.”’<br>

So he got up and went back to his father.<br>

While he was still a long way off,<br>

his father caught sight of him, and was filled with compassion.<br>

He ran to his son, embraced him and kissed him.<br>

His son said to him,<br>

‘Father, I have sinned against heaven and against you;<br>

I no longer deserve to be called your son.’<br>

But his father ordered his servants,<br>

‘Quickly bring the finest robe and put it on him;<br>

put a ring on his finger and sandals on his feet.<br>

Take the fattened calf and slaughter it.<br>

Then let us celebrate with a feast,<br>

because this son of mine was dead, and has come to life again;<br>

he was lost, and has been found.’<br>

Then the celebration began.<br>

Now the older son had been out in the field<br>

and, on his way back, as he neared the house,<br>

he heard the sound of music and dancing.<br>

He called one of the servants and asked what this might mean.<br>

The servant said to him,<br>

‘Your brother has returned<br>

and your father has slaughtered the fattened calf<br>

because he has him back safe and sound.’<br>

He became angry,<br>

and when he refused to enter the house,<br>

his father came out and pleaded with him.<br>

He said to his father in reply,<br>

‘Look, all these years I served you<br>

and not once did I disobey your orders;<br>

yet you never gave me even a young goat to feast on with my friends.<br>

But when your son returns<br>

who swallowed up your property with prostitutes,<br>

for him you slaughter the fattened calf.’<br>

He said to him,<br>

‘My son, you are here with me always;<br>

everything I have is yours.<br>

But now we must celebrate and rejoice,<br>

because your brother was dead and has come to life again;<br>

he was lost and has been found.’”</p>
