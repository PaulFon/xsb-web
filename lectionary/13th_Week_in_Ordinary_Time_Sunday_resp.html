<div class="poetry">
<p>R. (2a)<strong> For ever I will sing the goodness of the Lord.</strong><br />
The promises of the LORD I will sing forever,<br />
through all generations my mouth shall proclaim your faithfulness.<br />
For you have said, “My kindness is established forever;”<br />
in heaven you have confirmed your faithfulness.<br />
R. <strong>For ever I will sing the goodness of the Lord.</strong><br />
Blessed the people who know the joyful shout;<br />
in the light of your countenance, O LORD, they walk.<br />
At your name they rejoice all the day,<br />
and through your justice they are exalted.<br />
R. <strong>For ever I will sing the goodness of the Lord.</strong><br />
You are the splendor of their strength,<br />
and by your favor our horn is exalted.<br />
For to the LORD belongs our shield,<br />
and the Holy One of Israel, our king.<br />
R. <strong>For ever I will sing the goodness of the Lord.</strong></p>
