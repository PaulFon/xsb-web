<div class="poetry">
<p>Thus says the LORD:<br />
Just as from the heavens<br />
the rain and snow come down<br />
and do not return there<br />
till they have watered the earth,<br />
making it fertile and fruitful,<br />
giving seed to the one who sows<br />
and bread to the one who eats,<br />
so shall my word be<br />
that goes forth from my mouth;<br />
my word shall not return to me void,<br />
but shall do my will,<br />
achieving the end for which I sent it.</p>
