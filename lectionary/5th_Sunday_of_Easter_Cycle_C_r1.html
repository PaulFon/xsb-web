  <p>A reading from the Acts of the Apostles.<br>

After Paul and Barnabas had proclaimed the good news<br>

to that city<br>

and made a considerable number of disciples,<br>

they returned to Lystra and to Iconium and to Antioch.<br>

They strengthened the spirits of the disciples<br>

and exhorted them to persevere in the faith, saying,<br>

“It is necessary for us to undergo many hardships<br>

to enter the kingdom of God.”<br>

They appointed elders for them in each church and,<br>

with prayer and fasting, commended them to the Lord<br>

in whom they had put their faith.<br>

Then they traveled through Pisidia and reached Pamphylia.<br>

After proclaiming the word at Perga they went down to Attalia.<br>

From there they sailed to Antioch,<br>

where they had been commended to the grace of God<br>

for the work they had now accomplished.<br>

And when they arrived, they called the church together<br>

and reported what God had done with them<br>

and how he had opened the door of faith to the Gentiles.</p>
