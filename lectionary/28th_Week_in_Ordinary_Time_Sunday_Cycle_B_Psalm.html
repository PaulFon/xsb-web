  <p>R. (14)    Fill us with your love, O Lord, and we will sing for joy!<br>

Teach us to number our days aright,<br>

    that we may gain wisdom of heart.<br>

Return, O LORD! How long?<br>

    Have pity on your servants!<br>

R. Fill us with your love, O Lord, and we will sing for joy!<br>

Fill us at daybreak with your kindness,<br>

    that we may shout for joy and gladness all our days.<br>

Make us glad, for the days when you afflicted us,<br>

    for the years when we saw evil.<br>

R. Fill us with your love, O Lord, and we will sing for joy!<br>

Let your work be seen by your servants<br>

    and your glory by their children;<br>

and may the gracious care of the LORD our God be ours;<br>

    prosper the work of our hands for us!<br>

    Prosper the work of our hands!<br>

R. Fill us with your love, O Lord, and we will sing for joy!</p>
