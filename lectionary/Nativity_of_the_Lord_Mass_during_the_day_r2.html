  <p>A reading from the Letter of Saint Paul to the Hebrews:<br>

Brothers and sisters:<br>

In times past, God spoke in partial and various ways <br>

    to our ancestors through the prophets; <br>

    in these last days, he has spoken to us through the Son, <br>

    whom he made heir of all things <br>

    and through whom he created the universe,<br>

        who is the refulgence of his glory,<br>

            the very imprint of his being,<br>

        and who sustains all things by his mighty word.<br>

        When he had accomplished purification from sins,<br>

        he took his seat at the right hand of the Majesty on high,<br>

        as far superior to the angels<br>

        as the name he has inherited is more excellent than theirs.<br>

<br>

For to which of the angels did God ever say:<br>

    You are my son; this day I have begotten you?<br>

Or again:<br>

    I will be a father to him, and he shall be a son to me?<br>

And again, when he leads the firstborn into the world, he says:<br>

    Let all the angels of God worship him.</p>
