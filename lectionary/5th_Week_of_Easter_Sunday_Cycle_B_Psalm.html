  <p>R. I Will Praise You, Lord, in the Assembly of Your People. Or: R. Alleluia. I will fulfill my vows before those who fear the Lord. The lowly shall eat their fill; they who seek the Lord shall praise him: "May your hearts live forever!" R. I will praise you, Lord, in the assembly of your people. Or: R. Alleluia. All the ends of the earth   shall remember and turn to the Lord; all the families of the nations   shall bow down before him. R. I will praise you, Lord, in the assembly of your people. Or: R. Alleluia. To him alone shall bow down all who sleep in the earth; before him shall bend all who go down into the dust. R. I will praise you, Lord, in the assembly of your people. Or: R. Alleluia. And to him my soul shall live; my descendants shall serve him. Let the coming generation be told of the Lord that they may proclaim to a people yet to be born the justice he has shown. R. I will praise you, Lord, in the assembly of your people. Or: R. Alleluia.</p>
