  <p>A Reading from the First letter of St. Paul to the Corinthians<br>

Brothers and sisters:<br>

When that which is mortal clothes itself with immortality,<br>

then the word that is written shall come about:<br>

<br>

    Death is swallowed up in victory.<br>

    Where, O death, is your victory?<br>

    Where, O death, is your sting?<br>

<br>

The sting of death is sin,<br>

and the power of sin is the law.<br>

But thanks be to God who gives us the victory<br>

through our Lord Jesus Christ.</p>
