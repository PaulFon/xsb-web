R. The Lord will bless his people with peace.<br>

The voice of the LORD is over the waters,<br>

            the LORD, over vast waters.<br>

The voice of the LORD is mighty;<br>

            the voice of the LORD is majestic. <br>

R. The Lord will bless his people with peace.<br>

The God of glory thunders,<br>

            and in his temple all say, “Glory!”<br>

OR:<br>

<br>

R. O bless the Lord, my soul.<br>

O LORD, my God, you are great indeed!<br>

     you are clothed with majesty and glory,<br>

robed in light as with a cloak.<br>

     You have spread out the heavens like a tent-cloth;<br>

R. O bless the Lord, my soul.<br>

You have constructed your palace upon the waters.<br>

     You make the clouds your chariot;<br>

you travel on the wings of the wind.<br>

     You make the winds your messengers,<br>

and flaming fire your ministers.<br>

R. O bless the Lord, my soul.<br>

How manifold are your works, O LORD!<br>

     In wisdom you have wrought them allC<br>

the earth is full of your creatures;<br>

     the sea also, great and wide,<br>

in which are schools without number<br>

     of living things both small and great.<br>

R. O bless the Lord, my soul.<br>

They look to you to give them food in due time.<br>

     When you give it to them, they gather it;<br>

when you open your hand, they are filled with good things.<br>

R. O bless the Lord, my soul.<br>

If you take away their breath, they perish and return to the dust.<br>

     When you send forth your spirit, they are created,<br>

and you renew the face of the earth.<br>

R. O bless the Lord, my soul.</p>
