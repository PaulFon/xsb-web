  <p>A reading from the First Letter <br>

of Saint Paul to the Corinthians:<br>

Brothers and sisters:<br>

It is written, The first man, Adam, became a living being,<br>

the last Adam a life-giving spirit.<br>

But the spiritual was not first;<br>

rather the natural and then the spiritual.<br>

The first man was from the earth, earthly;<br>

the second man, from heaven.<br>

As was the earthly one, so also are the earthly,<br>

and as is the heavenly one, so also are the heavenly.<br>

Just as we have borne the image of the earthly one,<br>

we shall also bear the image of the heavenly one.</p>
