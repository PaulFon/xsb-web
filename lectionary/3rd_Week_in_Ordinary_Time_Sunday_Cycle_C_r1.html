  <p>A reading from the Book of Nehemiah: <br>

Ezra the priest brought the law before the assembly,<br>

which consisted of men, women,<br>

and those children old enough to understand.<br>

Standing at one end of the open place that was before the Water Gate,<br>

he read out of the book from daybreak till midday,<br>

in the presence of the men, the women,<br>

and those children old enough to understand;<br>

and all the people listened attentively to the book of the law.<br>

Ezra the scribe stood on a wooden platform <br>

that had been made for the occasion.<br>

He opened the scroll<br>

so that all the people might see it<br>

— for he was standing higher up than any of the people —;<br>

and, as he opened it, all the people rose.<br>

Ezra blessed the LORD, the great God,<br>

and all the people, their hands raised high, answered, <br>

“Amen, amen!”<br>

Then they bowed down and prostrated themselves before the LORD,<br>

their faces to the ground.<br>

Ezra read plainly from the book of the law of God,<br>

interpreting it so that all could understand what was read.<br>

Then Nehemiah, that is, His Excellency, and Ezra the priest-scribe<br>

and the Levites who were instructing the people<br>

said to all the people:<br>

“Today is holy to the LORD your God.<br>

Do not be sad, and do not weep”—<br>

for all the people were weeping as they heard the words of the law.<br>

He said further: “Go, eat rich foods and drink sweet drinks,<br>

and allot portions to those who had nothing prepared;<br>

for today is holy to our LORD.<br>

Do not be saddened this day,<br>

for rejoicing in the LORD must be your strength!”</p>
