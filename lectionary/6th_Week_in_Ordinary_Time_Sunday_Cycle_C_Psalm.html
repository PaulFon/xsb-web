  <p>R Blessed are they who hope in the Lord.<br>

Blessed the man who follows not<br>

the counsel of the wicked,<br>

nor walks in the way of sinners,<br>

nor sits in the company of the insolent,<br>

but delights in the law of the LORD<br>

and meditates on his law day and night.<br>

R Blessed are they who hope in the Lord.<br>

He is like a tree<br>

planted near running water,<br>

that yields its fruit in due season,<br>

and whose leaves never fade.<br>

Whatever he does, prospers.<br>

R Blessed are they who hope in the Lord.<br>

Not so the wicked, not so;<br>

they are like chaff which the wind drives away.<br>

For the LORD watches over the way of the just,<br>

but the way of the wicked vanishes.<br>

R Blessed are they who hope in the Lord.</p>
