  <p>Let us pray.<br>

<br>

Grant, almighty God,<br>

<br>

that we may celebrate with heartfelt devotion these days of joy, <br>

<br>

which we keep in honour of the risen Lord,<br>

<br>

and that what we relive in remembrance<br>

<br>

we may always hold to in what we do.<br>

<br>

<br>

<br>

Through our Lord Jesus Christ, your Son,<br>

<br>

who lives and reigns with you in the unity of the Holy Spirit, <br>

<br>

one God, for ever and ever.</p>
