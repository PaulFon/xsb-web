<div class="poetry">
<p>R. (see 17b) <strong>You saved my life, O Lord; I shall not die.</strong><br />
Once I said,<br />
“In the noontime of life I must depart!<br />
To the gates of the nether world I shall be consigned<br />
for the rest of my years.”<br />
R. <strong>You saved my life, O Lord; I shall not die.</strong><br />
I said, “I shall see the LORD no more<br />
in the land of the living.<br />
No longer shall I behold my fellow men<br />
among those who dwell in the world.”<br />
R. <strong>You saved my life, O Lord; I shall not die.</strong><br />
My dwelling, like a shepherd’s tent,<br />
is struck down and borne away from me;<br />
You have folded up my life, like a weaver<br />
who severs the last thread.<br />
R. <strong>You saved my life, O Lord; I shall not die.</strong><br />
Those live whom the LORD protects;<br />
yours is the life of my spirit.<br />
You have given me health and life.<br />
R. <strong>You saved my life, O Lord; I shall not die.</strong></p>
