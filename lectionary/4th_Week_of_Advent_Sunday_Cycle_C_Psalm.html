  <p>R. Lord, make us turn to you; let us see your face and we shall be saved.<br>

O shepherd of Israel, hearken,<br>

    from your throne upon the cherubim, shine forth.<br>

Rouse your power,<br>

    and come to save us.<br>

R. Lord, make us turn to you; let us see your face and we shall be saved.<br>

Once again, O LORD of hosts,<br>

    look down from heaven, and see;<br>

take care of this vine,<br>

    and protect what your right hand has planted<br>

the son of man whom you yourself made strong.<br>

R. Lord, make us turn to you; let us see your face and we shall be saved.<br>

May your help be with the man of your right hand,<br>

    with the son of man whom you yourself made strong.<br>

Then we will no more withdraw from you;<br>

    give us new life, and we will call upon your name.<br>

R. Lord, make us turn to you; let us see your face and we shall be saved.</p>
