  <p>Jesus went to the Mount of Olives.<br>

But early in the morning he arrived again in the temple area,<br>

and all the people started coming to him,<br>

and he sat down and taught them.<br>

Then the scribes and the Pharisees brought a woman<br>

who had been caught in adultery<br>

and made her stand in the middle.<br>

They said to him,<br>

“Teacher, this woman was caught<br>

in the very act of committing adultery.<br>

Now in the law, Moses commanded us to stone such women.<br>

So what do you say?”<br>

They said this to test him,<br>

so that they could have some charge to bring against him.<br>

Jesus bent down and began to write on the ground with his finger.<br>

But when they continued asking him,<br>

he straightened up and said to them,<br>

“Let the one among you who is without sin<br>

be the first to throw a stone at her.”<br>

Again he bent down and wrote on the ground.<br>

And in response, they went away one by one,<br>

beginning with the elders.<br>

So he was left alone with the woman before him.<br>

Then Jesus straightened up and said to her,<br>

“Woman, where are they?<br>

Has no one condemned you?”<br>

She replied, “No one, sir.”<br>

Then Jesus said, “Neither do I condemn you.<br>

Go, and from now on do not sin any more.”</p>
