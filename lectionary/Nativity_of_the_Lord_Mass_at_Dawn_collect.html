  <p>Grant, we pray, almighty God, that, as we are bathed in the<br>

new radiance of your incarnate Word, the light of faith, which illumines<br>

our minds, may also shine through in our deeds. Through our Lord<br>

Jesus Christ, your Son, who lives and reigns with you in the unity of the<br>

Holy Spirit, God, for ever and ever. R. Amen.</p>
