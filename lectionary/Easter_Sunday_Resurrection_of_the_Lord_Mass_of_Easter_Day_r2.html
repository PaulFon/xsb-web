  <p>Brothers and sisters:<br>
If then you were raised with Christ, seek what is above, <br>
where Christ is seated at the right hand of God.<br>
Think of what is above, not of what is on earth.<br>
For you have died, and your life is hidden with Christ in God.<br>
When Christ your life appears,<br>
then you too will appear with him in glory.<br>
<br>
OR:<br>
<br>
I Cor 5:6b-8<br>
<br>
Brothers and sisters:<br>
Do you not know that a little yeast leavens all the dough?<br>
Clear out the old yeast,<br>
so that you may become a fresh batch of dough, <br>
inasmuch as you are unleavened.<br>
For our paschal lamb, Christ, has been sacrificed.<br>
Therefore, let us celebrate the feast, <br>
not with the old yeast, the yeast of malice and wickedness, <br>
but with the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth.</p>
