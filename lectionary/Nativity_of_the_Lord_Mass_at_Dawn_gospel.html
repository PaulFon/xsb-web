  <p>A reading from the holy Gospel according to Luke.<br>

When the angels went away from them to heaven,<br>

the shepherds said to one another, <br>

“Let us go, then, to Bethlehem<br>

to see this thing that has taken place, <br>

which the Lord has made known to us.”<br>

So they went in haste and found Mary and Joseph, <br>

and the infant lying in the manger.<br>

When they saw this,<br>

they made known the message<br>

that had been told them about this child.<br>

All who heard it were amazed<br>

by what had been told them by the shepherds.<br>

And Mary kept all these things,<br>

reflecting on them in her heart.<br>

Then the shepherds returned,<br>

glorifying and praising God <br>

for all they had heard and seen, <br>

just as it had been told to them.</p>
