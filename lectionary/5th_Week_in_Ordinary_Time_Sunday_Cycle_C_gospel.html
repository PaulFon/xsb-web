  <p>A reading from the Gospel according to Luke <br>

R. Glory to you, O Lord. <br>

While the crowd was pressing in on Jesus and listening to the word of God,<br>

he was standing by the Lake of Gennesaret.<br>

He saw two boats there alongside the lake;<br>

the fishermen had disembarked and were washing their nets.<br>

Getting into one of the boats, the one belonging to Simon,<br>

he asked him to put out a short distance from the shore.<br>

Then he sat down and taught the crowds from the boat.<br>

After he had finished speaking, he said to Simon,<br>

"Put out into deep water and lower your nets for a catch."<br>

Simon said in reply,<br>

"Master, we have worked hard all night and have caught nothing,<br>

but at your command I will lower the nets."<br>

When they had done this, they caught a great number of fish<br>

and their nets were tearing.<br>

They signaled to their partners in the other boat<br>

to come to help them. <br>

They came and filled both boats<br>

so that the boats were in danger of sinking.<br>

When Simon Peter saw this, he fell at the knees of Jesus and said,<br>

"Depart from me, Lord, for I am a sinful man."<br>

For astonishment at the catch of fish they had made seized him<br>

and all those with him,<br>

and likewise James and John, the sons of Zebedee,<br>

who were partners of Simon.<br>

Jesus said to Simon, "Do not be afraid;<br>

from now on you will be catching men."<br>

When they brought their boats to the shore,<br>

they left everything and followed him.<br>
