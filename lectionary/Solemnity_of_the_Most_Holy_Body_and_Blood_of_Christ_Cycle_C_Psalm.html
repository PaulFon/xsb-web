  <p>R You are a priest for ever, in the line of Melchizedek.<br>

The LORD said to my Lord: "Sit at my right hand<br>

till I make your enemies your footstool."<br>

R You are a priest for ever, in the line of Melchizedek.<br>

The scepter of your power the LORD will stretch forth from Zion:<br>

"Rule in the midst of your enemies."<br>

R You are a priest for ever, in the line of Melchizedek.<br>

"Yours is princely power in the day of your birth, in holy splendor;<br>

 before the daystar, like the dew, I have begotten you."<br>

R You are a priest for ever, in the line of Melchizedek.<br>

The LORD has sworn, and he will not repent:<br>

"You are a priest forever, according to the order of  Melchizedek."<br>

R You are a priest for ever, in the line of Melchizedek.</p>
