  <p>A reading from the holy Gospel according to Luke.<br>

In the fifteenth year of the reign of Tiberius Caesar, <br>

when Pontius Pilate was governor of Judea, <br>

and Herod was tetrarch of Galilee,<br>

and his brother Philip tetrarch of the region<br>

of Ituraea and Trachonitis, <br>

and Lysanias was tetrarch of Abilene, <br>

during the high priesthood of Annas and Caiaphas, <br>

the word of God came to John the son of Zechariah in the desert.<br>

John went throughout the whole region of the Jordan, <br>

proclaiming a baptism of repentance for the forgiveness of sins, <br>

as it is written in the book of the words of the prophet Isaiah:<br>

    A voice of one crying out in the desert:<br>

    “Prepare the way of the Lord,<br>

        make straight his paths.<br>

    Every valley shall be filled<br>

        and every mountain and hill shall be made low.<br>

    The winding roads shall be made straight,<br>

        and the rough ways made smooth,<br>

    and all flesh shall see the salvation of God.”</p>
