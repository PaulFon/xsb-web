  <p>A reading from the book of Wisdom: <br>

I prayed, and prudence was given me;<br>

        I pleaded, and the spirit of wisdom came to me.<br>

    I preferred her to scepter and throne,<br>

    and deemed riches nothing in comparison with her,<br>

        nor did I liken any priceless gem to her;<br>

    because all gold, in view of her, is a little sand,<br>

        and before her, silver is to be accounted mire.<br>

    Beyond health and comeliness I loved her,<br>

    and I chose to have her rather than the light,<br>

        because the splendor of her never yields to sleep.<br>

    Yet all good things together came to me in her company,<br>

        and countless riches at her hands.</p>
