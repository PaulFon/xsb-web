<h4>Reading 1 <a href="/bible/jeremiah/20:10">Jer 20:10-13</a></h4>
<div class="poetry">
<p>Jeremiah said:<br />
“I hear the whisperings of many:<br />
‘Terror on every side!<br />
Denounce! let us denounce him!’<br />
All those who were my friends<br />
are on the watch for any misstep of mine.<br />
‘Perhaps he will be trapped; then we can prevail,<br />
and take our vengeance on him.’<br />
But the LORD is with me, like a mighty champion:<br />
my persecutors will stumble, they will not triumph.<br />
In their failure they will be put to utter shame,<br />
to lasting, unforgettable confusion.<br />
O LORD of hosts, you who test the just,<br />
who probe mind and heart,<br />
let me witness the vengeance you take on them,<br />
for to you I have entrusted my cause.<br />
Sing to the LORD,<br />
praise the LORD,<br />
for he has rescued the life of the poor<br />
from the power of the wicked!”</p>
