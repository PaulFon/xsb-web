  <p>Jesus took Peter, James, and John and led them up a high mountain apart by themselves. And he was<br>

transfigured before them, and his clothes became dazzling white, such as no fuller on earth could bleach<br>

them. Then Elijah appeared to them along with Moses, and they were conversing with Jesus. Then Peter<br>

said to Jesus in reply, “Rabbi, it is good that we are here! Let us make three tents: one for you, one for<br>

Moses, and one for Elijah.” He hardly knew what to say, they were so terrified. Then a cloud came, casting<br>

a shadow over them; from the cloud came a voice, “This is my beloved Son. Listen to him.” Suddenly,<br>

looking around, they no longer saw anyone but Jesus alone with them.<br>

As they were coming down from the mountain, he charged them not to relate what they had seen to<br>

anyone, except when the Son of Man had risen from the dead. So they kept the matter to themselves,<br>

questioning what rising from the dead meant. </p>
