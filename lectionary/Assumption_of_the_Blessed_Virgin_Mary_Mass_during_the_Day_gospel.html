  <p>A reading from the holy Gospel according to Luke. R. Glory to you, O Lord.<br>

Mary set out<br>

and traveled to the hill country in haste<br>

to a town of Judah,<br>

where she entered the house of Zechariah<br>

and greeted Elizabeth.<br>

When Elizabeth heard Mary’s greeting,<br>

the infant leaped in her womb,<br>

and Elizabeth, filled with the Holy Spirit,<br>

cried out in a loud voice and said,<br>

“Blessed are you among women,<br>

and blessed is the fruit of your womb.<br>

And how does this happen to me,<br>

that the mother of my Lord should come to me?<br>

For at the moment the sound of your greeting reached my ears,<br>

the infant in my womb leaped for joy.<br>

Blessed are you who believed<br>

that what was spoken to you by the Lord<br>

would be fulfilled.”<br>

<br>

And Mary said:<br>

<br>

    “My soul proclaims the greatness of the Lord;<br>

        my spirit rejoices in God my Savior<br>

        for he has looked with favor on his lowly servant.<br>

    From this day all generations will call me blessed:<br>

        the Almighty has done great things for me<br>

        and holy is his Name.<br>

    He has mercy on those who fear him<br>

        in every generation.<br>

    He has shown the strength of his arm,<br>

        and has scattered the proud in their conceit.<br>

    He has cast down the mighty from their thrones,<br>

        and has lifted up the lowly.<br>

    He has filled the hungry with good things,<br>

        and the rich he has sent away empty.<br>

    He has come to the help of his servant Israel<br>

        for he has remembered his promise of mercy,<br>

        the promise he made to our fathers,<br>

        to Abraham and his children forever.”<br>

<br>

Mary remained with her about three months<br>

and then returned to her home.</p>
