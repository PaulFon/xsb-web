  <p>O God, who, looking on the lowliness<br>

of the Blessed Virgin Mary,<br>

raised her to this grace,<br>

that your Only Begotten Son was born of her<br>

according to the flesh and that she was crowned this day<br>

with surpassing glory,<br>

grant through her prayers,<br>

that, saved by the mystery of your redemption,<br>

we may merit to be exalted by you on high.<br>

<br>

Through our Lord Jesus Christ, your Son,<br>

who lives and reigns with you<br>

in the unity of the Holy Spirit, one God, for ever and ever.</p>
