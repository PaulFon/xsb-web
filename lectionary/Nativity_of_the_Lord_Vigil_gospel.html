  <p>A reading from the holy Gospel according to Matthew. R.<br>

The book of the genealogy of Jesus Christ, <br>

the son of David, the son of Abraham.<br>

<br>

Abraham became the father of Isaac,<br>

Isaac the father of Jacob, <br>

Jacob the father of Judah and his brothers.<br>

Judah became the father of Perez and Zerah,<br>

whose mother was Tamar.<br>

Perez became the father of Hezron,<br>

Hezron the father of Ram, <br>

Ram the father of Amminadab.<br>

Amminadab became the father of Nahshon,<br>

Nahshon the father of Salmon,<br>

Salmon the father of Boaz,<br>

whose mother was Rahab.<br>

Boaz became the father of Obed,<br>

whose mother was Ruth.<br>

Obed became the father of Jesse,<br>

Jesse the father of David the king.<br>

<br>

David became the father of Solomon, <br>

whose mother had been the wife of Uriah.<br>

Solomon became the father of Rehoboam,<br>

Rehoboam the father of Abijah,<br>

Abijah the father of Asaph.<br>

Asaph became the father of Jehoshaphat,<br>

Jehoshaphat the father of Joram,<br>

Joram the father of Uzziah.<br>

Uzziah became the father of Jotham,<br>

Jotham the father of Ahaz, <br>

Ahaz the father of Hezekiah.<br>

Hezekiah became the father of Manasseh,<br>

Manasseh the father of Amos,<br>

<br>

Amos the father of Josiah.<br>

Josiah became the father of Jechoniah and his brothers<br>

at the time of the Babylonian exile.<br>

<br>

After the Babylonian exile,<br>

Jechoniah became the father of Shealtiel, <br>

Shealtiel the father of Zerubbabel,<br>

Zerubbabel the father of Abiud.<br>

Abiud became the father of Eliakim,<br>

Eliakim the father of Azor,<br>

Azor the father of Zadok.<br>

Zadok became the father of Achim,<br>

Achim the father of Eliud, <br>

Eliud the father of Eleazar.<br>

Eleazar became the father of Matthan,<br>

Matthan the father of Jacob, <br>

Jacob the father of Joseph, the husband of Mary.<br>

Of her was born Jesus who is called the Christ.<br>

<br>

Thus the total number of generations<br>

from Abraham to David<br>

is fourteen generations; <br>

from David to the Babylonian exile,<br>

fourteen generations; <br>

from the Babylonian exile to the Christ,<br>

fourteen generations. <br>

<br>

Now this is how the birth of Jesus Christ came about.<br>

When his mother Mary was betrothed to Joseph, <br>

but before they lived together, <br>

she was found with child through the Holy Spirit.<br>

Joseph her husband, since he was a righteous man, <br>

yet unwilling to expose her to shame, <br>

decided to divorce her quietly.<br>

Such was his intention when, behold,<br>

the angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream and said, <br>

“Joseph, son of David, <br>

do not be afraid to take Mary your wife into your home.<br>

For it is through the Holy Spirit <br>

that this child has been conceived in her.<br>

She will bear a son and you are to name him Jesus, <br>

because he will save his people from their sins.”<br>

All this took place to fulfill<br>

what the Lord had said through the prophet:<br>

    Behold, the virgin shall conceive and bear a son,<br>

        and they shall name him Emmanuel, <br>

which means “God is with us.”<br>

When Joseph awoke,<br>

he did as the angel of the Lord had commanded him <br>

and took his wife into his home.<br>

He had no relations with her until she bore a son, <br>

and he named him Jesus.<br>

<br>

OR:<br>

<br>

Mt 1:18-25<br>

<br>

This is how the birth of Jesus Christ came about.<br>

When his mother Mary was betrothed to Joseph, <br>

but before they lived together, <br>

she was found with child through the Holy Spirit.<br>

Joseph her husband, since he was a righteous man, <br>

yet unwilling to expose her to shame, <br>

decided to divorce her quietly.<br>

Such was his intention when, behold,<br>

the angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream and said, <br>

“Joseph, son of David, <br>

do not be afraid to take Mary your wife into your home.<br>

For it is through the Holy Spirit <br>

that this child has been conceived in her.<br>

She will bear a son and you are to name him Jesus, <br>

because he will save his people from their sins.”<br>

All this took place to fulfill<br>

what the Lord had said through the prophet:<br>

    Behold, the virgin shall conceive and bear a son,<br>

        and they shall name him Emmanuel,<br>

which means “God is with us.”<br>

When Joseph awoke,<br>

he did as the angel of the Lord had commanded him <br>

and took his wife into his home.<br>

He had no relations with her until she bore a son, <br>

and he named him Jesus.</p>
