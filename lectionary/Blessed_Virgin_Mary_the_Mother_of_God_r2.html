  <p>A reading from the Letter of Saint Paul to the Galatians: <br>

Brothers and sisters:<br>

When the fullness of time had come, God sent his Son,  <br>

born of a woman, born under the law,  <br>

to ransom those under the law,  <br>

so that we might receive adoption as sons.<br>

As proof that you are sons,  <br>

God sent the Spirit of his Son into our hearts,  <br>

crying out, “Abba, Father!”<br>

So you are no longer a slave but a son,  <br>

and if a son then also an heir, through God.</p>
