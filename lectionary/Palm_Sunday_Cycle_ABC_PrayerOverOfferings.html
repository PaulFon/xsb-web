  <p>Through the Passion of your Only Begotten Son, O Lord,<br>

may our reconciliation with you be near at hand,<br>

so that, though we do not merit it by our own deeds,<br>

yet by this sacrifice made once for all,<br>

we may feel already the effects of your mercy.<br>

Through Christ our Lord.</p>
