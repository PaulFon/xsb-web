  <p>O God, who wonderfully created the dignity of human nature<br>

and still more wonderfully restored it, grant, we pray, that we may share<br>

in the divinity of Christ, who humbled himself to share in our humanity.<br>

Who lives and reigns with you in the unity of the Holy Spirit, God, for<br>

ever and ever. R. Amen.</p>
