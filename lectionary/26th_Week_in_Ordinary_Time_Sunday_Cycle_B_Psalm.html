  <p>R. The Precepts of the Lord Give Joy to the Heart. The law of the Lord is perfect, refreshing the soul; the decree of the Lord is trustworthy, giving wisdom to the simple. R. The precepts of the Lord give joy to the heart. The fear of the Lord is pure, enduring forever; the ordinances of the Lord are true, all of them just. R. The precepts of the Lord give joy to the heart. Though your servant is careful of them, very diligent in keeping them, yet who can detect failings? Cleanse me from my unknown faults! R. The precepts of the Lord give joy to the heart. From wanton sin especially, restrain your servant; let it not rule over me. Then shall I be blameless and innocent of serious sin. R. The precepts of the Lord give joy to the heart.</p>
