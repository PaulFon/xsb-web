  <p>May the gifts we have received from your altar, Lord,<br>

kindle in our hearts a longing for the heavenly homeland<br>

and cause us to press forward, <br>

following in the Saviour’s footsteps, <br>

to the place where for our sake he entered before us.<br>

Who lives and reigns for ever and ever.</p>
