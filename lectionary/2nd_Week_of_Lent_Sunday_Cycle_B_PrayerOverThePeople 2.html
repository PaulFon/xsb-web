  <p>Bless your faithful, we pray, O Lord, <br>
with a blessing that endures for ever, <br>
and keep them faithful <br>
to the Gospel of your Only Begotten Son, <br>
so that they may always desire and at last attain <br>
that glory whose beauty he showed in his own Body, <br>
to the amazement of his Apostles. <br>
Through Christ our Lord. R. Amen.</p>
