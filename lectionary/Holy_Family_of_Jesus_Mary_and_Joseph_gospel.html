  <p>A reading from the holy Gospel according to Luke. R. Glory to you, O Lord. <br>

Each year Jesus’ parents went to Jerusalem for the feast<br>

of Passover, <br>

and when he was twelve years old, <br>

they went up according to festival custom.<br>

After they had completed its days, as they were returning, <br>

the boy Jesus remained behind in Jerusalem, <br>

but his parents did not know it.<br>

Thinking that he was in the caravan,<br>

they journeyed for a day<br>

and looked for him among their relatives and acquaintances, <br>

but not finding him,<br>

they returned to Jerusalem to look for him.<br>

After three days they found him in the temple, <br>

sitting in the midst of the teachers, <br>

listening to them and asking them questions, <br>

and all who heard him were astounded <br>

at his understanding and his answers.<br>

When his parents saw him,<br>

they were astonished, <br>

and his mother said to him, <br>

“Son, why have you done this to us?<br>

Your father and I have been looking for you with great anxiety.”<br>

And he said to them,<br>

“Why were you looking for me?<br>

Did you not know that I must be in my Father’s house?”<br>

But they did not understand what he said to them.<br>

He went down with them and came to Nazareth,<br>

and was obedient to them; <br>

and his mother kept all these things in her heart.<br>

And Jesus advanced in wisdom and age and favor<br>

before God and man.</p>
