  <p>Ez.2:2-5—A reading from the book of Ezekiel: As the Lord<br>

spoke to me, the spirit entered into me and set me on my feet, and I<br>

heard the one who was speaking say to me: Son of man, I am sending<br>

you to the Israelites, rebels who have rebelled against me; they and<br>

their ancestors have revolted against me to this very day. Hard of face<br>

and obstinate of heart are they to whom I am sending you. But you shall<br>

say to them: Thus says the Lord God! And whether they heed or resist <br>

for they are a rebellious house—they shall know that a prophet has<br>

been among them.—The word of the Lord. R. Thanks be to God.</p>
