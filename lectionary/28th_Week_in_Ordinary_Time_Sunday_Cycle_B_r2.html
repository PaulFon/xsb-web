  <p>A reading from the letter of Saint Paul to the Hebrews: <br>

Brothers and sisters:<br>

Indeed the word of God is living and effective,<br>

sharper than any two-edged sword,<br>

penetrating even between soul and spirit, joints and marrow,<br>

and able to discern reflections and thoughts of the heart.<br>

No creature is concealed from him,<br>

but everything is naked and exposed to the eyes of him<br>

to whom we must render an account.</p>
