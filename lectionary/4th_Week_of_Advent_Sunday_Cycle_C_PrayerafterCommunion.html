  <p>Having received this pledge of eternal<br>

redemption, we pray, almighty God, that, as the feast day of our<br>

salvation draws ever nearer, so we may press forward all the more<br>

eagerly to the worthy celebration of the mystery of your Son's Nativity.<br>

Who lives and reigns for ever and ever. R. Amen.</p>
