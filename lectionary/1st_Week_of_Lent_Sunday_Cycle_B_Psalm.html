  <p>R. Your Ways, O Lord, Are Love and Truth to Those Who Keep Your Covenant. Your ways, O Lord, make known to me; teach me your paths, Guide me in your truth and teach me, for you are God my savior. R. Your ways, O Lord, are love and truth to those who keep your covenant. Remember that your compassion, O Lord, and your love are from of old. In your kindness remember me, because of your goodness, O Lord. R. Your ways, O Lord, are love and truth to those who keep your covenant. Good and upright is the Lord, thus he shows sinners the way. He guides the humble to justice, and he teaches the humble his way. R. Your ways, O Lord, are love and truth to those who keep your covenant.</p>
