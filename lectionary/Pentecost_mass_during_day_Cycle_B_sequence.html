  <p>Come, Holy Spirit, come!<br>

And from your celestial home<br>

Shed a ray of light divine!<br>

<br>

Come, Father of the poor!<br>

Come, source of all our store!<br>

Come, within our bosoms shine.<br>

<br>

You, of comforters the best;<br>

You, the soul's most welcome guest;<br>

Sweet refreshment here below;<br>

<br>

In our labor, rest most sweet;<br>

Grateful coolness in the heat;<br>

Solace in the midst of woe.<br>

<br>

O most blessed Light divine,<br>

Shine within these hearts of yours,<br>

And our inmost being fill!<br>

<br>

Where you are not, we have naught,<br>

Nothing good in deed or thought,<br>

Nothing free from taint of ill.<br>

<br>

Heal our wounds, our strength renew;<br>

On our dryness pour your dew;<br>

Wash the stains of guilt away:<br>

<br>

Bend the stubborn heart and will;<br>

Melt the frozen, warm the chill;<br>

Guide the steps that go astray.<br>

<br>

On the faithful, who adore<br>

And confess you, evermore<br>

In your sevenfold gift descend;<br>

<br>

Give them virtue's sure reward;<br>

Give them your salvation, Lord;<br>

Give them joys that never end. Amen.<br>

Alleluia.</p>
