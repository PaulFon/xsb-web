  <p>A reading from the Acts of the Apostles<br>

Some who had come down from Judea were instructing the brothers,<br>

“Unless you are circumcised according to the Mosaic practice,<br>

you cannot be saved.”<br>

Because there arose no little dissension and debate<br>

by Paul and Barnabas with them,<br>

it was decided that Paul, Barnabas, and some of the others<br>

should go up to Jerusalem to the apostles and elders<br>

about this question.<br>

<br>

The apostles and elders, in agreement with the whole church,<br>

decided to choose representatives<br>

and to send them to Antioch with Paul and Barnabas.<br>

The ones chosen were Judas, who was called Barsabbas,<br>

and Silas, leaders among the brothers.<br>

This is the letter delivered by them:<br>

<br>

“The apostles and the elders, your brothers,<br>

to the brothers in Antioch, Syria, and Cilicia<br>

of Gentile origin: greetings.<br>

Since we have heard that some of our number<br>

who went out without any mandate from us<br>

have upset you with their teachings<br>

and disturbed your peace of mind,<br>

we have with one accord decided to choose representatives<br>

and to send them to you along with our beloved Barnabas and Paul,<br>

who have dedicated their lives to the name of our Lord Jesus Christ.<br>

So we are sending Judas and Silas<br>

who will also convey this same message by word of mouth:<br>

‘It is the decision of the Holy Spirit and of us<br>

not to place on you any burden beyond these necessities,<br>

namely, to abstain from meat sacrificed to idols,<br>

from blood, from meats of strangled animals,<br>

and from unlawful marriage.<br>

If you keep free of these,<br>

you will be doing what is right.  Farewell.’”</p>
