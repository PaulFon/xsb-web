  <p>A reading from the holy Gospel according to John. R. Glory to you, O Lord. <br>

There was a wedding at Cana in Galilee,<br>

and the mother of Jesus was there.<br>

Jesus and his disciples were also invited to the wedding.<br>

When the wine ran short,<br>

the mother of Jesus said to him,<br>

“They have no wine.”<br>

And Jesus said to her,<br>

“Woman, how does your concern affect me?<br>

My hour has not yet come.”<br>

His mother said to the servers,<br>

“Do whatever he tells you.”<br>

Now there were six stone water jars there for Jewish ceremonial washings,<br>

each holding twenty to thirty gallons.<br>

Jesus told them,<br>

“Fill the jars with water.”<br>

So they filled them to the brim.<br>

Then he told them,<br>

“Draw some out now and take it to the headwaiter.”<br>

So they took it. <br>

And when the headwaiter tasted the water that had become wine,<br>

without knowing where it came from<br>

— although the servers who had drawn the water knew —,<br>

the headwaiter called the bridegroom and said to him,<br>

“Everyone serves good wine first,<br>

and then when people have drunk freely, an inferior one;<br>

but you have kept the good wine until now.”<br>

Jesus did this as the beginning of his signs at Cana in Galilee<br>

and so revealed his glory,<br>

and his disciples began to believe in him.</p>
