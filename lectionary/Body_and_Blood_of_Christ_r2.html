<div class="poetry">
<p>Brothers and sisters:<br />
The cup of blessing that we bless,<br />
is it not a participation in the blood of Christ?<br />
The bread that we break,<br />
is it not a participation in the body of Christ?<br />
Because the loaf of bread is one,<br />
we, though many, are one body,<br />
for we all partake of the one loaf.</p>
