<div class="poetry">
<p>Brothers and sisters:<br />
The Spirit comes to the aid of our weakness;<br />
for we do not know how to pray as we ought,<br />
but the Spirit himself intercedes with inexpressible groanings.<br />
And the one who searches hearts<br />
knows what is the intention of the Spirit,<br />
because he intercedes for the holy ones<br />
according to God’s will.</p>
