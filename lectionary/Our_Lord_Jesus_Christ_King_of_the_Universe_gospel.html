  <p>A reading from the holy Gospel according to John.<br>

Pilate said to Jesus,<br>

"Are you the King of the Jews?" <br>

Jesus answered, "Do you say this on your own<br>

or have others told you about me?" <br>

Pilate answered, "I am not a Jew, am I? <br>

Your own nation and the chief priests handed you over to me. <br>

What have you done?" <br>

Jesus answered, "My kingdom does not belong to this world.<br>

If my kingdom did belong to this world,<br>

my attendants would be fighting<br>

to keep me from being handed over to the Jews. <br>

But as it is, my kingdom is not here." <br>

So Pilate said to him, "Then you are a king?" <br>

Jesus answered, "You say I am a king. <br>

For this I was born and for this I came into the world,<br>

to testify to the truth. <br>

Everyone who belongs to the truth listens to my voice."</p>
