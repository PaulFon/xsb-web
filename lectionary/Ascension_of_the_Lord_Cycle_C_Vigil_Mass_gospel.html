  <p>Jesus said to his disciples:<br>

“Thus it is written that the Christ would suffer<br>

and rise from the dead on the third day<br>

and that repentance, for the forgiveness of sins,<br>

would be preached in his name<br>

to all the nations, beginning from Jerusalem.<br>

You are witnesses of these things.<br>

And behold I am sending the promise of my Father upon you;<br>

but stay in the city<br>

until you are clothed with power from on high.”<br>

<br>

Then he led them out as far as Bethany,<br>

raised his hands, and blessed them.<br>

As he blessed them he parted from them<br>

and was taken up to heaven.<br>

They did him homage<br>

and then returned to Jerusalem with great joy,<br>

and they were continually in the temple praising God.</p>
