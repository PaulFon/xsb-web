      <body><h4>Gospel <a href="/bible/matthew/11:20">Mt 11:20-24</a></h4>
<div class="poetry">
<p>Jesus began to reproach the towns<br />
where most of his mighty deeds had been done,<br />
since they had not repented.<br />
“Woe to you, Chorazin! Woe to you, Bethsaida!<br />
For if the mighty deeds done in your midst<br />
had been done in Tyre and Sidon,<br />
they would long ago have repented in sackcloth and ashes.<br />
But I tell you, it will be more tolerable<br />
for Tyre and Sidon on the day of judgment than for you.<br />
And as for you, Capernaum:</p>
<p>Will you be exalted to heaven?<br />
You will go down to the nether world.</p>
<p>For if the mighty deeds done in your midst had been done in Sodom,<br />
it would have remained until this day.<br />
But I tell you, it will be more tolerable<br />
for the land of Sodom on the day of judgment than for you.”</p>
