  <p>R I will praise you, Lord, for you have rescued me.<br>

or:<br>

R  Alleluia.<br>

I will extol you, O LORD, for you drew me clear<br>

and did not let my enemies rejoice over me.<br>

O LORD, you brought me up from the netherworld;<br>

you preserved me from among those going down into the pit.<br>

R  I will praise you, Lord, for you have rescued me.<br>

or:<br>

R  Alleluia.<br>

Sing praise to the LORD, you his faithful ones,<br>

and give thanks to his holy name.<br>

For his anger lasts but a moment;<br>

a lifetime, his good will.<br>

At nightfall, weeping enters in,<br>

but with the dawn, rejoicing.<br>

R  I will praise you, Lord, for you have rescued me.<br>

or:<br>

R  Alleluia.<br>

Hear, O LORD, and have pity on me;<br>

O LORD, be my helper.<br>

You changed my mourning into dancing;<br>

O LORD, my God, forever will I give you thanks.<br>

R  I will praise you, Lord, for you have rescued me.<br>

or:<br>

R  Alleluia.</p>
