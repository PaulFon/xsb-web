  <p>A reading from the Book of Genesis:<br>

After the man, Adam, had eaten of the tree,<br>

the LORD God called to the man and asked him, “Where are you?”<br>

He answered, “I heard you in the garden;<br>

but I was afraid, because I was naked,<br>

so I hid myself.”<br>

Then he asked, “Who told you that you were naked?<br>

You have eaten, then,<br>

from the tree of which I had forbidden you to eat!”<br>

The man replied, “The woman whom you put here with me<br>

she gave me fruit from the tree, and so I ate it.”<br>

The LORD God then asked the woman,<br>

“Why did you do such a thing?”<br>

The woman answered, “The serpent tricked me into it, so I ate it.”<br>

Then the LORD God said to the serpent:<br>

    “Because you have done this, you shall be banned<br>

        from all the animals<br>

        and from all the wild creatures;<br>

    on your belly shall you crawl,<br>

        and dirt shall you eat<br>

        all the days of your life.<br>

    I will put enmity between you and the woman,<br>

        and between your offspring and hers;<br>

    he will strike at your head,<br>

        while you strike at his heel.”<br>

The man called his wife Eve,<br>

because she became the mother of all the living.</p>
