  <p>R. The Lord is kind and merciful.<br>

Bless the LORD, O my soul;<br>

and all my being, bless his holy name.<br>

Bless the LORD, O my soul,<br>

and forget not all his benefits.<br>

R. The Lord is kind and merciful.<br>

He pardons all your iniquities,<br>

heals all your ills,<br>

He redeems your life from destruction,<br>

crowns you with kindness and compassion.<br>

R. The Lord is kind and merciful.<br>

The LORD secures justice<br>

and the rights of all the oppressed.<br>

He has made known his ways to Moses,<br>

and his deeds to the children of Israel.<br>

R. The Lord is kind and merciful.<br>

Merciful and gracious is the LORD,<br>

slow to anger and abounding in kindness.<br>

For as the heavens are high above the earth,<br>

so surpassing is his kindness toward those who fear him.<br>

R. The Lord is kind and merciful.</p>
