<div class="poetry">
<p>R. (52b) <strong>Glory and praise for ever!</strong>
Blessed are you, O Lord, the God of our fathers,
praiseworthy and exalted above all forever;
And blessed is your holy and glorious name,
praiseworthy and exalted above all for all ages.
R. <strong>Glory and praise for ever!</strong></p>

<p>Blessed are you in the temple of your holy glory,
praiseworthy and glorious above all forever.
    R. <strong>Glory and praise for ever!</strong></p>

<p>Blessed are you on the throne of your kingdom,
praiseworthy and exalted above all forever.
    R. <strong>Glory and praise for ever!</strong></p>

<p>Blessed are you who look into the depths
from your throne upon the cherubim,
praiseworthy and exalted above all forever.
R. <strong>Glory and praise for ever!</strong></p>
