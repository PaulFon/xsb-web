  <p>A reading from the Letter of Saint Paul to Titus:<br>

Beloved:<br>

The grace of God has appeared, saving all<br>

and training us to reject godless ways and worldly desires <br>

and to live temperately, justly, and devoutly in this age, <br>

as we await the blessed hope, <br>

the appearance of the glory of our great God <br>

and savior Jesus Christ,<br>

who gave himself for us to deliver us from all lawlessness <br>

and to cleanse for himself a people as his own, <br>

eager to do what is good.</p>
