  <p>A reading from the Letter of Saint Paul to the Hebrews:<br>

Brothers and sisters:<br>

Since we have a great high priest who has passed through the heavens, <br>

Jesus, the Son of God,<br>

let us hold fast to our confession.<br>

For we do not have a high priest<br>

who is unable to sympathize with our weaknesses,<br>

but one who has similarly been tested in every way,<br>

yet without sin. <br>

So let us confidently approach the throne of grace<br>

to receive mercy and to find grace for timely help.</p>
