  <p>A reading from the holy Gospel according to Luke. <br>

R. Glory to you, O Lord. <br>

Jesus came down with the Twelve<br>

and stood on a stretch of level ground<br>

with a great crowd of his disciples<br>

and a large number of the people<br>

from all Judea and Jerusalem<br>

and the coastal region of Tyre and Sidon.<br>

And raising his eyes toward his disciples he said:<br>

            “Blessed are you who are poor,<br>

                        for the kingdom of God is yours.<br>

            Blessed are you who are now hungry,<br>

                        for you will be satisfied.<br>

            Blessed are you who are now weeping,<br>

                        for you will laugh.<br>

            Blessed are you when people hate you,<br>

                        and when they exclude and insult you,<br>

                        and denounce your name as evil<br>

                        on account of the Son of Man.<br>

Rejoice and leap for joy on that day!<br>

Behold, your reward will be great in heaven.<br>

For their ancestors treated the prophets in the same way.<br>

But woe to you who are rich,<br>

for you have received your consolation.<br>

Woe to you who are filled now,<br>

for you will be hungry.<br>

Woe to you who laugh now,<br>

for you will grieve and weep.<br>

Woe to you when all speak well of you,<br>

for their ancestors treated the false prophets in this way.”<br>
