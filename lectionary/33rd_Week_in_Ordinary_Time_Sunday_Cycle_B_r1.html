  <p>A reading from the book of Daniel: <br>

In those days, I Daniel, <br>

    heard this word of the Lord:<br>

"At that time there shall arise<br>

    Michael, the great prince,<br>

    guardian of your people;<br>

it shall be a time unsurpassed in distress<br>

    since nations began until that time.<br>

At that time your people shall escape,<br>

    everyone who is found written in the book.<br>

<br>

“Many of those who sleep in the dust of the earth shall awake;<br>

    some shall live forever,<br>

    others shall be an everlasting horror and disgrace.<br>

<br>

“But the wise shall shine brightly<br>

    like the splendor of the firmament,<br>

and those who lead the many to justice<br>

    shall be like the stars forever."</p>
