  <p>A reading from the Gospel according to Luke<br>

Jesus took Peter, John, and James<br>

and went up the mountain to pray.<br>

While he was praying his face changed in appearance<br>

and his clothing became dazzling white.<br>

And behold, two men were conversing with him, Moses and Elijah,<br>

who appeared in glory and spoke of his exodus<br>

that he was going to accomplish in Jerusalem.<br>

Peter and his companions had been overcome by sleep,<br>

but becoming fully awake,<br>

they saw his glory and the two men standing with him.<br>

As they were about to part from him, Peter said to Jesus,<br>

“Master, it is good that we are here;<br>

let us make three tents,<br>

one for you, one for Moses, and one for Elijah.”<br>

But he did not know what he was saying.<br>

While he was still speaking,<br>

a cloud came and cast a shadow over them,<br>

and they became frightened when they entered the cloud.<br>

Then from the cloud came a voice that said,<br>

“This is my chosen Son; listen to him.”<br>

After the voice had spoken, Jesus was found alone.<br>

They fell silent and did not at that time<br>

tell anyone what they had seen.</p>
