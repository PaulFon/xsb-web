  <p>Let them thank the Lord for his mercy, <br>

his wonders for the children of men, <br>

for he satisfies the thirsty soul, <br>

and the hungry he fills with good things.<br>

Or: Blessed are those who mourn, for they shall be consoled. <br>

Blessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness, <br>

for they shall have their fill.</p>
