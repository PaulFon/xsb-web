  <p>A reading from the letter of St. Paul to the Corinthians<br>

Brothers and sisters:<br>

I received from the Lord what I also handed on to you,<br>

that the Lord Jesus, on the night he was handed over,<br>

took bread, and, after he had given thanks,<br>

broke it and said, "This is my body that is for you.<br>

Do this in remembrance of me."<br>

In the same way also the cup, after supper, saying,<br>

"This cup is the new covenant in my blood.<br>

Do this, as often as you drink it, in remembrance of me."<br>

For as often as you eat this bread and drink the cup,<br>

you proclaim the death of the Lord until he comes.</p>
