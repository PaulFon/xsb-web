  <p>A reading from the holy Gospel according to Mark.<br>

One of the scribes came to Jesus and asked him,<br>

"Which is the first of all the commandments?" <br>

Jesus replied, "The first is this:<br>

Hear, O Israel!<br>

The Lord our God is Lord alone!<br>

You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart,<br>

with all your soul, <br>

with all your mind,<br>

and with all your strength.<br>

The second is this:<br>

You shall love your neighbor as yourself.<br>

There is no other commandment greater than these." <br>

The scribe said to him, "Well said, teacher.<br>

You are right in saying,<br>

'He is One and there is no other than he.'<br>

And 'to love him with all your heart,<br>

with all your understanding,<br>

with all your strength,<br>

and to love your neighbor as yourself'<br>

is worth more than all burnt offerings and sacrifices."<br>

And when Jesus saw that he answered with understanding,<br>

he said to him,<br>

"You are not far from the kingdom of God." <br>

And no one dared to ask him any more questions.</p>
