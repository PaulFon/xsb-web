<div class="poetry">
<p>Jesus said to the Jewish crowds:<br />
&quot;I am the living bread that came down from heaven;<br />
whoever eats this bread will live forever;<br />
and the bread that I will give<br />
is my flesh for the life of the world.&quot;</p>
<p>The Jews quarreled among themselves, saying,<br />
&quot;How can this man give us his flesh to eat?&quot;<br />
Jesus said to them,<br />
&quot;Amen, amen, I say to you,<br />
unless you eat the flesh of the Son of Man and drink his blood,<br />
you do not have life within you.<br />
Whoever eats my flesh and drinks my blood<br />
has eternal life,<br />
and I will raise him on the last day.<br />
For my flesh is true food,<br />
and my blood is true drink.<br />
Whoever eats my flesh and drinks my blood<br />
remains in me and I in him.<br />
Just as the living Father sent me<br />
and I have life because of the Father,<br />
so also the one who feeds on me<br />
will have life because of me.<br />
This is the bread that came down from heaven.<br />
Unlike your ancestors who ate and still died,<br />
whoever eats this bread will live forever.&quot;</p>
