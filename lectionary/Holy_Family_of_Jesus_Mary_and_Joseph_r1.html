  <p>A reading from the Book of Sirach:<br>

God sets a father in honor over his children; a mother's authority he confirms over her sons. Whoever honors his father atones for sins, and preserves himself from them. When he prays, he is heard; he stores up riches who reveres his mother. Whoever honors his father is gladdened by children, and, when he prays, is heard. Whoever reveres his father will live a long life; he who obeys his father brings comfort to his mother. My son, take care of your father when he is old; grieve him not as long as he lives. Even if his mind fail, be considerate of him; revile him not all the days of his life; kindness to a father will not be forgotten, firmly planted against the debt of your sins—a house raised in justice to you.—The word of the Lord. R. Thanks be to God.<br>

1 Sm 1:20-22, 24-28<br>

<br>

In those days Hannah conceived, and at the end of her term bore a son<br>

whom she called Samuel, since she had asked the LORD for him.<br>

The next time her husband Elkanah was going up<br>

with the rest of his household<br>

to offer the customary sacrifice to the LORD and to fulfill his vows,<br>

Hannah did not go, explaining to her husband,<br>

“Once the child is weaned,<br>

I will take him to appear before the LORD<br>

and to remain there forever;<br>

I will offer him as a perpetual nazirite.”<br>

<br>

Once Samuel was weaned, Hannah brought him up with her,<br>

along with a three-year-old bull,<br>

an ephah of flour, and a skin of wine,<br>

and presented him at the temple of the LORD in Shiloh.<br>

After the boy’s father had sacrificed the young bull,<br>

Hannah, his mother, approached Eli and said:<br>

“Pardon, my lord!<br>

As you live, my lord,<br>

I am the woman who stood near you here, praying to the LORD.<br>

I prayed for this child, and the LORD granted my request.<br>

Now I, in turn, give him to the LORD;<br>

as long as he lives, he shall be dedicated to the LORD.”<br>

Hannah left Samuel there.</p>
