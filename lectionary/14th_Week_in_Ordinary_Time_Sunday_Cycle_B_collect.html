  <p>O God, who in the abasement of your Son have raised up a<br>

<br>

fallen world, fill your faithful with holy joy, for on those you have rescued<br>

from slavery to sin you bestow eternal gladness. Through our Lord<br>

Jesus Christ, your Son, who lives and reigns with you in the unity of the<br>

Holy Spirit, God, for ever and ever. R. Amen.</p>
