  <p>Filled with the Holy Spirit, Jesus returned from the Jordan<br>

and was led by the Spirit into the desert for forty days,<br>

to be tempted by the devil.<br>

He ate nothing during those days,<br>

and when they were over he was hungry.<br>

The devil said to him,<br>

“If you are the Son of God,<br>

command this stone to become bread.”<br>

Jesus answered him,<br>

“It is written, One does not live on bread alone.”<br>

Then he took him up and showed him<br>

all the kingdoms of the world in a single instant.<br>

The devil said to him,<br>

“I shall give to you all this power and glory;<br>

for it has been handed over to me,<br>

and I may give it to whomever I wish.<br>

All this will be yours, if you worship me.”<br>

Jesus said to him in reply,<br>

“It is written<br>

You shall worship the Lord, your God,<br>

and him alone shall you serve.”<br>

Then he led him to Jerusalem,<br>

made him stand on the parapet of the temple, and said to him,<br>

“If you are the Son of God,<br>

throw yourself down from here, for it is written:<br>

He will command his angels concerning you, to guard you,<br>

 and:<br>

With their hands they will support you,<br>

lest you dash your foot against a stone.”<br>

Jesus said to him in reply,<br>

“It also says,<br>

You shall not put the Lord, your God, to the test.”<br>

When the devil had finished every temptation,<br>

he departed from him for a time.</p>
