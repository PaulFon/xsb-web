  <p>R.    (8)  Lord, go up to the place of your rest, you and the ark of your holiness.<br>

Behold, we heard of it in Ephrathah;<br>

    we found it in the fields of Jaar.<br>

Let us enter his dwelling,<br>

    let us worship at his footstool.<br>

R.    Lord, go up to the place of your rest, you and the ark of your holiness.<br>

May your priests be clothed with justice;<br>

    let your faithful ones shout merrily for joy.<br>

For the sake of David your servant,<br>

    reject not the plea of your anointed.<br>

R.    Lord, go up to the place of your rest, you and the ark of your holiness.<br>

For the LORD has chosen Zion;<br>

    he prefers her for his dwelling.<br>

“Zion is my resting place forever;<br>

    in her will I dwell, for I prefer her.”<br>

R.    Lord, go up to the place of your rest, you and the ark of your holiness.</p>
