  <p>A reading from the holy Gospel according to John. <br>

R. Glory to you, O Lord.<br>

In the beginning was the Word,<br>

        and the Word was with God,<br>

        and the Word was God.<br>

    He was in the beginning with God. <br>

    All things came to be through him,<br>

        and without him nothing came to be.<br>

    What came to be through him was life,<br>

        and this life was the light of the human race;<br>

    the light shines in the darkness,<br>

        and the darkness has not overcome it.<br>

A man named John was sent from God.<br>

He came for testimony, to testify to the light, <br>

so that all might believe through him.<br>

He was not the light,<br>

but came to testify to the light.<br>

The true light, which enlightens everyone, was coming into the world.<br>

    He was in the world,<br>

        and the world came to be through him,<br>

        but the world did not know him.<br>

    He came to what was his own,<br>

        but his own people did not accept him.<br>

<br>

But to those who did accept him<br>

he gave power to become children of God, <br>

to those who believe in his name, <br>

who were born not by natural generation <br>

nor by human choice nor by a man’s decision <br>

but of God.<br>

    And the Word became flesh<br>

        and made his dwelling among us,<br>

        and we saw his glory,<br>

        the glory as of the Father’s only Son,<br>

        full of grace and truth.<br>

John testified to him and cried out, saying, <br>

“This was he of whom I said, <br>

‘The one who is coming after me ranks ahead of me <br>

because he existed before me.’”<br>

From his fullness we have all received,<br>

grace in place of grace,<br>

because while the law was given through Moses, <br>

grace and truth came through Jesus Christ.<br>

No one has ever seen God.<br>

The only Son, God, who is at the Father’s side, <br>

has revealed him.<br>

<br>

Jn 1:1-5, 9-14<br>

<br>

    In the beginning was the Word,<br>

        and the Word was with God,<br>

        and the Word was God.<br>

    He was in the beginning with God. <br>

    All things came to be through him,<br>

        and without him nothing came to be.<br>

    What came to be through him was life,<br>

        and this life was the light of the human race;<br>

    the light shines in the darkness,<br>

        and the darkness has not overcome it.<br>

The true light, which enlightens everyone, was coming into the world.<br>

    He was in the world,<br>

        and the world came to be through him,<br>

        but the world did not know him.<br>

    He came to what was his own,<br>

        but his own people did not accept him.<br>

<br>

But to those who did accept him<br>

he gave power to become children of God, <br>

to those who believe in his name, <br>

who were born not by natural generation <br>

nor by human choice nor by a man’s decision <br>

but of God.<br>

    And the Word became flesh<br>

        and made his dwelling among us,<br>

        and we saw his glory,<br>

        the glory as of the Father’s only Son,<br>

        full of grace and truth.</p>
