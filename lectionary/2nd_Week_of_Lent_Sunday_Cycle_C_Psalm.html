  <p>R. (1a)  The Lord is my light and my salvation.<br>

The LORD is my light and my salvation;<br>

whom should I fear?<br>

The LORD is my life’s refuge;<br>

of whom should I be afraid?<br>

R. The Lord is my light and my salvation.<br>

Hear, O LORD, the sound of my call;<br>

have pity on me, and answer me.<br>

Of you my heart speaks; you my glance seeks.<br>

R. The Lord is my light and my salvation.<br>

Your presence, O LORD, I seek.<br>

Hide not your face from me;<br>

do not in anger repel your servant.<br>

You are my helper: cast me not off.<br>

R. The Lord is my light and my salvation.<br>

I believe that I shall see the bounty of the LORD<br>

in the land of the living.<br>

Wait for the LORD with courage;<br>

be stouthearted, and wait for the LORD.<br>

R. The Lord is my light and my salvation.</p>
