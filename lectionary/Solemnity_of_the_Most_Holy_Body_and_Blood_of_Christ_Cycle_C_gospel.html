  <p>A reading from the Gospel of Luke<br>

Jesus spoke to the crowds about the kingdom of God,<br>

and he healed those who needed to be cured.<br>

As the day was drawing to a close,<br>

the Twelve approached him and said,<br>

"Dismiss the crowd<br>

so that they can go to the surrounding villages and farms<br>

and find lodging and provisions;<br>

for we are in a deserted place here."<br>

He said to them, "Give them some food yourselves."<br>

They replied, "Five loaves and two fish are all we have,<br>

unless we ourselves go and buy food for all these people."<br>

Now the men there numbered about five thousand.<br>

Then he said to his disciples,<br>

"Have them sit down in groups of about fifty."<br>

They did so and made them all sit down.<br>

Then taking the five loaves and the two fish,<br>

and looking up to heaven,<br>

he said the blessing over them, broke them,<br>

and gave them to the disciples to set before the crowd.<br>

They all ate and were satisfied.<br>

And when the leftover fragments were picked up,<br>

they filled twelve wicker baskets.</p>
