  <p>A reading from the Gospel of John<br>

Glory to you O Lord.<br>

When Judas had left them, Jesus said,<br>

“Now is the Son of Man glorified, and God is glorified in him.<br>

If God is glorified in him,<br>

God will also glorify him in himself,<br>

and God will glorify him at once.<br>

My children, I will be with you only a little while longer.<br>

I give you a new commandment: love one another.<br>

As I have loved you, so you also should love one another.<br>

This is how all will know that you are my disciples,<br>

if you have love for one another.”</p>
