  <p>A reading from the book of Revelation<br>

Then I, John, saw a new heaven and a new earth.<br>

The former heaven and the former earth had passed away,<br>

and the sea was no more.<br>

I also saw the holy city, a new Jerusalem,<br>

coming down out of heaven from God,<br>

prepared as a bride adorned for her husband.<br>

I heard a loud voice from the throne saying,<br>

“Behold, God’s dwelling is with the human race.<br>

He will dwell with them and they will be his people<br>

and God himself will always be with them as their God.<br>

He will wipe every tear from their eyes,<br>

and there shall be no more death or mourning, wailing or pain,<br>

for the old order has passed away.”<br>

<br>

The One who sat on the throne said,<br>

“Behold, I make all things new.”</p>
