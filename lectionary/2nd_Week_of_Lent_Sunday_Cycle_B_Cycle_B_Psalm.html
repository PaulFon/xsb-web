  <p>R. I Will Walk before the Lord, in the Land of the Living. <br>

I believed, even when I said, <br>

"I am greatly afflicted." <br>

Precious in the eyes of the Lord <br>

is the death of his faithful ones. <br>

<br>

R. I will walk before the Lord, in the land of the living. <br>

<br>

O Lord, I am your servant; <br>

I am your servant, the son of your handmaid; <br>

you have loosed my bonds. To you will I offer sacrifice of thanksgiving, and I will call upon the name of the Lord. R. I will walk before the Lord, in the land of the living. My vows to the Lord I will pay in the presence of all his people, In the courts of the house of the Lord, in your midst, O Jerusalem. R. I will walk before the Lord, in the land of the living.<br>
