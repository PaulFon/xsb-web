  <p>A Reading from the first Book of Chronicles<br>
      
      David assembled all Israel in Jerusalem to bring the ark of the Lord<br>

to the place which he had prepared for it.<br>

David also called together the sons of Aaron and the Levites.<br>

The Levites bore the ark of God on their shoulders with poles,<br>

as Moses had ordained according to the word of the Lord.<br>


David commanded the chiefs of the Levites<br>

to appoint their kinsmen as chanters,<br>

to play on musical instruments, harps, lyres, and cymbals,<br>

to make a loud sound of rejoicing.<br>


They brought in the ark of God and set it within the tent<br>

which David had pitched for it.<br>

Then they offered up burnt offerings and peace offerings to God.<br>

When David had finished offering up the burnt offerings and peace offerings,<br>

he blessed the people in the name of the Lord.</p>
