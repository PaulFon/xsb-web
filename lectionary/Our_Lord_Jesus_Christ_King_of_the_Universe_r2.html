  <p>A reading from the Book of Revelation: <br>

Jesus Christ is the faithful witness,<br>

the firstborn of the dead and ruler of the kings of the earth. <br>

To him who loves us and has freed us from our sins by his blood,<br>

who has made us into a kingdom, priests for his God and Father,<br>

to him be glory and power forever and ever.  Amen.<br>

Behold, he is coming amid the clouds,<br>

and every eye will see him,<br>

even those who pierced him.<br>

All the peoples of the earth will lament him.<br>

Yes.  Amen.<br>

<br>

"I am the Alpha and the Omega, " says the Lord God,<br>

"the one who is and who was and who is to come, the almighty."</p>
