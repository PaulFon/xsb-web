  <p>A reading from the Book of Micha:<br>

Thus says the LORD:<br>

    You, Bethlehem-Ephrathah<br>

        too small to be among the clans of Judah,<br>

    from you shall come forth for me<br>

        one who is to be ruler in Israel;<br>

    whose origin is from of old,<br>

        from ancient times.<br>

    Therefore the Lord will give them up, until the time<br>

        when she who is to give birth has borne,<br>

    and the rest of his kindred shall return<br>

        to the children of Israel.<br>

    He shall stand firm and shepherd his flock<br>

        by the strength of the LORD,<br>

        in the majestic name of the LORD, his God;<br>

    and they shall remain, for now his greatness<br>

        shall reach to the ends of the earth;<br>

        he shall be peace.</p>
