<p>Let us pray.<br>
O God, whose Son today ascended to the heavens<br class="sline">
as the Apostles looked on, <br class="sline">
grant, we pray, that, in accordance with his promise,<br class="sline">
we may be worthy for him to live with us always on earth, <br class="sline">
and we with him in heaven.<br class="sline">
Who lives and reigns with you in the unity of the Holy Spirit,<br class="sline">
one God, for ever and ever.</p>
