  <p>Graciously accept the saving sacrifice which<br>

we offer you, O Lord, on the Solemnity of the Immaculate Conception of<br>

the Blessed Virgin Mary, and grant that, as we profess her, on account<br>

of your prevenient grace, to be untouched by any stain of sin, so,<br>

through her intercession, we may be delivered from all our faults.<br>

Through Christ our Lord. R. Amen.</p>
