  <p>A reading from the First Letter of Saint Paul to the Corinthians: <br>

Brothers and sisters:<br>

Strive eagerly for the greatest spiritual gifts.<br>

But I shall show you a still more excellent way.<br>

If I speak in human and angelic tongues,<br>

but do not have love,<br>

I am a resounding gong or a clashing cymbal.<br>

And if I have the gift of prophecy,<br>

and comprehend all mysteries and all knowledge;<br>

if I have all faith so as to move mountains,<br>

but do not have love, I am nothing.<br>

If I give away everything I own,<br>

and if I hand my body over so that I may boast,<br>

but do not have love, I gain nothing.<br>

Love is patient, love is kind.<br>

It is not jealous, it is not pompous,<br>

It is not inflated, it is not rude,<br>

it does not seek its own interests,<br>

it is not quick-tempered, it does not brood over injury,<br>

it does not rejoice over wrongdoing<br>

but rejoices with the truth.<br>

It bears all things, believes all things,<br>

hopes all things, endures all things.<br>

Love never fails.<br>

If there are prophecies, they will be brought to nothing;<br>

if tongues, they will cease;<br>

if knowledge, it will be brought to nothing.<br>

For we know partially and we prophesy partially,<br>

but when the perfect comes, the partial will pass away.<br>

When I was a child, I used to talk as a child,<br>

think as a child, reason as a child;<br>

when I became a man, I put aside childish things.<br>

At present we see indistinctly, as in a mirror,<br>

but then face to face.<br>

At present I know partially;<br>

then I shall know fully, as I am fully known.<br>

So faith, hope, love remain, these three;<br>

but the greatest of these is love.<br>

OR: <br>
