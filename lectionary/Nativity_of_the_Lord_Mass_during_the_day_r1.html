  <p>A reading from the Book of the Prophet Isaiah:<br>

How beautiful upon the mountains<br>

        are the feet of him who brings glad tidings,<br>

    announcing peace, bearing good news,<br>

        announcing salvation, and saying to Zion,<br>

        “Your God is King!”<br>

<br>

    Hark!  Your sentinels raise a cry,<br>

        together they shout for joy,<br>

    for they see directly, before their eyes,<br>

        the LORD restoring Zion.<br>

    Break out together in song,<br>

        O ruins of Jerusalem!<br>

    For the LORD comforts his people,<br>

        he redeems Jerusalem.<br>

    The LORD has bared his holy arm<br>

        in the sight of all the nations;<br>

    all the ends of the earth will behold<br>

        the salvation of our God.</p>
