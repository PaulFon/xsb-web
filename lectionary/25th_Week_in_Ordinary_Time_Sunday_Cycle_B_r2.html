  <p>A reading from the letter of James: Beloved: Where jealousy and selfish ambition exist, there is disorder and every foul practice.  But the wisdom from above is first of all pure, then peaceable, gentle, compliant, full of mercy and good fruits, without inconstancy or insincerity. And the fruit of righteousness is sown in peace for those who cultivate peace. Where do the wars and where do the conflicts among you come from? Is it not from your passions that make war within your members? You covet but do not possess.  You kill and envy but you cannot obtain; you fight and wage war.   You do not possess because you do not ask. You ask but do not receive, because you ask wrongly, to spend it on your passions.—The word of the Lord. R. Thanks be to God.</p>
