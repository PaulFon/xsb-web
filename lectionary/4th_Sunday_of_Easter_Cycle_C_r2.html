  <p>A reading from the book of Revelation<br>

I, John, had a vision of a great multitude,<br>

which no one could count,<br>

from every nation, race, people, and tongue.<br>

They stood before the throne and before the Lamb,<br>

wearing white robes and holding palm branches in their hands.<br>

Then one of the elders said to me,<br>

“These are the ones who have survived the time of great distress;<br>

they have washed their robes<br>

and made them white in the blood of the Lamb.<br>

“For this reason they stand before God’s throne<br>

and worship him day and night in his temple.<br>

The one who sits on the throne will shelter them.<br>

They will not hunger or thirst anymore,<br>

nor will the sun or any heat strike them.<br>

For the Lamb who is in the center of the throne<br>

will shepherd them<br>

and lead them to springs of life-giving water,<br>

and God will wipe away every tear from their eyes.”</p>
