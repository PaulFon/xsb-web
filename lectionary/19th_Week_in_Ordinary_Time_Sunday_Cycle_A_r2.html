  <p>Reading II: Rom.9:1-5 </p>
  <p>A reading from the letter of Saint Paul to the Romans: </p>
  Brothers and sisters: <br class="sline">
  I speak the truth in Christ, I do not lie; <br class="sline">
  my conscience joins with the Holy Spirit in bearing me witness <br class="sline">
  that I have great sorrow and constant anguish in my heart. <br class="sline">
  For I could wish that I myself were accursed and cut off from Christ <br class="sline">
  for the sake of my own people, <br class="sline">
  my kindred according to the flesh.  <br class="sline">
  They are Israelites; <br class="sline">
  theirs the adoption, the glory, the covenants, <br class="sline">
  the giving of the law, the worship, and the promises; <br class="sline">
  theirs the patriarchs, and from them, <br class="sline">
  according to the flesh, is the Christ, <br class="sline">
  who is over all, God blessed forever. Amen</p>
  <p>The word of the Lord. <br class="sline">
  R. Thanks be to God.</p>
