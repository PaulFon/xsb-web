  <p>A reading from the book of Wisdom: The souls of the just are in the hand of God,<br>

    and no torment shall touch them.<br>

They seemed, in the view of the foolish, to be dead;<br>

    and their passing away was thought an affliction<br>

    and their going forth from us, utter destruction.<br>

But they are in peace.<br>

For if before men, indeed, they be punished,<br>

    yet is their hope full of immortality;<br>

chastised a little, they shall be greatly blessed,<br>

    because God tried them<br>

    and found them worthy of himself.<br>

As gold in the furnace, he proved them,<br>

    and as sacrificial offerings he took them to himself.<br>

In the time of their visitation they shall shine,<br>

    and shall dart about as sparks through stubble;<br>

they shall judge nations and rule over peoples,<br>

    and the Lord shall be their King forever.<br>

Those who trust in him shall understand truth,<br>

    and the faithful shall abide with him in love:<br>

because grace and mercy are with his holy ones,<br>

    and his care is with his elect.</p>
