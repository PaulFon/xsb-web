  <p>May God, who through the childbearing<br>

of the Blessed Virgin Mary<br>

willed in his great kindness<br>

to redeem the human race,<br>

be pleased to enrich you with his blessing.<br>

<br>

Amen.<br>

<br>

May you know always and everywhere<br>

the protection of her, through whom you have been found worthy<br>

to receive the author of life.<br>

<br>

Amen.<br>

<br>

May you, who have devoutly gathered on this day,<br>

carry away with you the gifts of spiritual joys and heavenly rewards.<br>

<br>

Amen.<br>

<br>

And may the blessing of almighty God,<br>

the Father, and the Son, + and the Holy Spirit,<br>

come down on you and remain with you for ever.</p>
