<h3>The Ascension of the Lord<br> Lectionary: 58</h3>

<h4>Reading 1 <a href="/bible/acts/1:11">Acts 1:1-11</a></h4>
<div class="poetry">
<p>In the first book, Theophilus,<br>
I dealt with all that Jesus did and taught<br>
until the day he was taken up,<br>
after giving instructions through the Holy Spirit<br>
to the apostles whom he had chosen.<br>
He presented himself alive to them<br>
by many proofs after he had suffered,<br>
appearing to them during forty days<br>
and speaking about the kingdom of God.<br>
While meeting with them,<br>
he enjoined them not to depart from Jerusalem,<br>
but to wait for “the promise of the Father<br>
about which you have heard me speak;<br>
for John baptized with water,<br>
but in a few days you will be baptized with the Holy Spirit.”</p>
<p>When they had gathered together they asked him,<br>
“Lord, are you at this time going to restore the kingdom to Israel?”<br>
He answered them, “It is not for you to know the times or seasons<br>
that the Father has established by his own authority.<br>
But you will receive power when the Holy Spirit comes upon you,<br>
and you will be my witnesses in Jerusalem,<br>
throughout Judea and Samaria,<br>
and to the ends of the earth.”<br>
When he had said this, as they were looking on,<br>
he was lifted up, and a cloud took him from their sight.<br>
While they were looking intently at the sky as he was going,<br>
suddenly two men dressed in white garments stood beside them.<br>
They said, “Men of Galilee,<br>
why are you standing there looking at the sky?<br>
This Jesus who has been taken up from you into heaven<br>
will return in the same way as you have seen him going into heaven.”</p>

<h4>Reading 2 <a href="/bible/ephesians/1:17">Eph 1:17-23</a></h4>
<div class="poetry">
<p>Brothers and sisters:<br>
May the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory,<br>
give you a Spirit of wisdom and revelation<br>
resulting in knowledge of him.<br>
May the eyes of your hearts be enlightened,<br>
that you may know what is the hope that belongs to his call,<br>
what are the riches of glory<br>
in his inheritance among the holy ones,<br>
and what is the surpassing greatness of his power<br>
for us who believe,<br>
in accord with the exercise of his great might,<br>
which he worked in Christ,<br>
raising him from the dead<br>
and seating him at his right hand in the heavens,<br>
far above every principality, authority, power, and dominion,<br>
and every name that is named<br>
not only in this age but also in the one to come.<br>
And he put all things beneath his feet<br>
and gave him as head over all things to the church,<br>
which is his body,<br>
the fullness of the one who fills all things in every way.</p>

<h4>Gospel <a href="/bible/matthew/28:16">Mt 28:16-20</a></h4>
<div class="poetry">
<p>The eleven disciples went to Galilee,<br>
to the mountain to which Jesus had ordered them.<br>
When they saw him, they worshiped, but they doubted.<br>
Then Jesus approached and said to them,<br>
“All power in heaven and on earth has been given to me.<br>
Go, therefore, and make disciples of all nations,<br>
baptizing them in the name of the Father,<br>
and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit,<br>
teaching them to observe all that I have commanded you.<br>
And behold, I am with you always, until the end of the age.”</p>
