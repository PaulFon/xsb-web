  <p>R. I Turn to You, Lord, in Time of Trouble, and You Fill Me With the Joy of Salvation. Blessed is he whose fault is taken away, whose sin is covered. Blessed the man to whom the Lord imputes not guilt, in whose spirit there is no guile. R. I turn to you, Lord, in time of trouble, and you fill me with the joy of salvation. Then I acknowledged my sin to you, my guilt I covered not. I said, "I confess my faults to the Lord," and you took away the guilt of my sin. R. I turn to you, Lord, in time of trouble, and you fill me with the joy of salvation. Be glad in the Lord and rejoice, you just; exult, all you upright of heart. R. I turn to you, Lord, in time of trouble, and you fill me with the joy of salvation.
