  <p>Almighty ever-living God, <br class="sline">
      whom, taught by the Holy Spirit, <br class="sline">
      we dare to call our Father, <br class="sline">
      bring, we pray, to perfection in our hearts <br class="sline">
      the spirit of adoption as your sons and daughters, <br class="sline">
      that we may merit to enter into the inheritance <br class="sline">
      which you have promised. </p>
      <p>Through our Lord Jesus Christ, your Son, <br class="sline">
          who lives and reigns with you in the unity of the Holy Spirit, <br class="sline">
          one God, for ever and ever. <br class="sline">
          R. Amen.</p>
