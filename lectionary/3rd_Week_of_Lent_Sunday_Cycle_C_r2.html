  <p>A Reading from the Letter of St. Paul to the Corinthians<br>

I do not want you to be unaware, brothers and sisters,<br>

that our ancestors were all under the cloud<br>

and all passed through the sea,<br>

and all of them were baptized into Moses<br>

in the cloud and in the sea.<br>

All ate the same spiritual food,<br>

and all drank the same spiritual drink,<br>

for they drank from a spiritual rock that followed them,<br>

and the rock was the Christ.<br>

Yet God was not pleased with most of them,<br>

for they were struck down in the desert.<br>

<br>

These things happened as examples for us,<br>

so that we might not desire evil things, as they did.<br>

Do not grumble as some of them did,<br>

and suffered death by the destroyer.<br>

These things happened to them as an example,<br>

and they have been written down as a warning to us,<br>

upon whom the end of the ages has come.<br>

Therefore, whoever thinks he is standing secure<br>

should take care not to fall.</p>
