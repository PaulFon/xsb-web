  <p>Christians, to the Paschal Victim<br>
    Offer your thankful praises!<br>
A Lamb the sheep redeems;<br>
    Christ, who only is sinless,<br>
    Reconciles sinners to the Father.<br>
Death and life have contended in that combat stupendous:<br>
    The Prince of life, who died, reigns immortal.<br>
Speak, Mary, declaring<br>
    What you saw, wayfaring.<br>
“The tomb of Christ, who is living,<br>
    The glory of Jesus’ resurrection;<br>
Bright angels attesting,<br>
    The shroud and napkin resting.<br>
Yes, Christ my hope is arisen;<br>
    to Galilee he goes before you.”<br>
Christ indeed from death is risen, our new life obtaining.<br>
    Have mercy, victor King, ever reigning!<br>
    Amen. Alleluia.</p>
