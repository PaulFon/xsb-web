  <p>O God, who have commanded us<br>

to listen to your beloved Son,<br>

be pleased, we pray,<br>

to nourish us inwardly by your word,<br>

that, with spiritual sight made pure,<br>

we may rejoice to behold your glory.<br>

Through our Lord Jesus Christ, your Son,<br>

who lives and reigns with you in the unity of the Holy Spirit,<br>

one God, for ever and ever.</p>
