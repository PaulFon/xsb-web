<h4>Reading 1 <a href="/bible/exodus/34:4">EX 34:4b-6, 8-9</a></h4>
<div class="poetry">
<p>Early in the morning Moses went up Mount Sinai
as the LORD had commanded him,
taking along the two stone tablets.</p>
<p>Having come down in a cloud, the LORD stood with Moses there
and proclaimed his name, &quot;LORD.&quot;
Thus the LORD passed before him and cried out,
&quot;The LORD, the LORD, a merciful and gracious God,
slow to anger and rich in kindness and fidelity.&quot;
Moses at once bowed down to the ground in worship.
Then he said, &quot;If I find favor with you, O Lord,
do come along in our company.
This is indeed a stiff-necked people; yet pardon our wickedness and sins,
and receive us as your own.&quot;</p>
