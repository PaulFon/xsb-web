<h4>Sequence</h4>

Veni, Sancte Spiritus
Come, Thou Holy Spirit, come! And from Thy celestial home Shed a ray of light divine!
Come, Thou Father of the poor! Come, Thou source of all our store! Come, within our bosoms shine.
Thou, of comforters the best; Thou, the soul’s most welcome Guest; Sweet refreshment here below;
In our labor, rest most sweet; Grateful coolness in the heat; Solace in the midst of woe.
O most blessed Light divine, Shine within these hearts of Thine, And our inmost being fill!
Where Thou are not, man hath naught, Nothing good in deed or thought, Nothing free from taint of ill.
Heal our wounds, our strength renew; On our dryness pour Thy dew; Wash the stains of guilt away:
Bend the stubborn heart and will; Melt the frozen, warm the chill; Guide the steps that go astray.
On the faithful, who adore And confess Thee, evermore In Thy sevenfold gift descend;
Give them virtue’s sure reward; Give them Thy salvation, Lord; Give them joys that never end.
Amen. Alleluia.
