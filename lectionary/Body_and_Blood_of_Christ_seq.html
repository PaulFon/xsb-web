<p>Lauda Sion</p>
<p>Laud, O Zion, your salvation,<br />
Laud with hymns of exultation,<br />
Christ, your king and shepherd true:</p>
<p>Bring him all the praise you know,<br />
He is more than you bestow.<br />
Never can you reach his due.</p>
<p>Special theme for glad thanksgiving<br />
Is the quick’ning and the living<br />
Bread today before you set:</p>
<p>From his hands of old partaken,<br />
As we know, by faith unshaken,<br />
Where the Twelve at supper met.</p>
<p>Full and clear ring out your chanting,<br />
Joy nor sweetest grace be wanting,<br />
From your heart let praises burst:</p>
<p>For today the feast is holden,<br />
When the institution olden<br />
Of that supper was rehearsed.</p>
<p>Here the new law’s new oblation,<br />
By the new king’s revelation,<br />
Ends the form of ancient rite:</p>
<p>Now the new the old effaces,<br />
Truth away the shadow chases,<br />
Light dispels the gloom of night.</p>
<p>What he did at supper seated,<br />
Christ ordained to be repeated,<br />
His memorial ne’er to cease:</p>
<p>And his rule for guidance taking,<br />
Bread and wine we hallow, making<br />
Thus our sacrifice of peace.</p>
<p>This the truth each Christian learns,<br />
Bread into his flesh he turns,<br />
To his precious blood the wine:</p>
<p>Sight has fail’d, nor thought conceives,<br />
But a dauntless faith believes,<br />
Resting on a pow’r divine.</p>
<p>Here beneath these signs are hidden<br />
Priceless things to sense forbidden;<br />
Signs, not things are all we see:</p>
<p>Blood is poured and flesh is broken,<br />
Yet in either wondrous token<br />
Christ entire we know to be.</p>
<p>Whoso of this food partakes,<br />
Does not rend the Lord nor breaks;<br />
Christ is whole to all that taste:</p>
<p>Thousands are, as one, receivers,<br />
One, as thousands of believers,<br />
Eats of him who cannot waste.</p>
<p>Bad and good the feast are sharing,<br />
Of what divers dooms preparing,<br />
Endless death, or endless life.</p>
<p>Life to these, to those damnation,<br />
See how like participation<br />
Is with unlike issues rife.</p>
<p>When the sacrament is broken,<br />
Doubt not, but believe ‘tis spoken,<br />
That each sever’d outward token<br />
doth the very whole contain.</p>
<p>Nought the precious gift divides,<br />
Breaking but the sign betides<br />
Jesus still the same abides,<br />
still unbroken does remain.</p>
<p><em>The shorter form of the sequence begins here.</em></p>
<p>Lo! the angel’s food is given<br />
To the pilgrim who has striven;<br />
see the children’s bread from heaven,<br />
which on dogs may not be spent.</p>
<p>Truth the ancient types fulfilling,<br />
Isaac bound, a victim willing,<br />
Paschal lamb, its lifeblood spilling,<br />
manna to the fathers sent.</p>
<p>Very bread, good shepherd, tend us,<br />
Jesu, of your love befriend us,<br />
You refresh us, you defend us,<br />
Your eternal goodness send us<br />
In the land of life to see.</p>
<p>You who all things can and know,<br />
Who on earth such food bestow,<br />
Grant us with your saints, though lowest,<br />
Where the heav’nly feast you show,<br />
Fellow heirs and guests to be. Amen. Alleluia.</p>
