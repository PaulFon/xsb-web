  <p>A reading from the Letter of Saint Paul to the Colossians: <br>

Brothers and sisters:<br>

Put on, as God’s chosen ones, holy and beloved,<br>

heartfelt compassion, kindness, humility, gentleness, and patience,<br>

bearing with one another and forgiving one another, <br>

if one has a grievance against another; <br>

as the Lord has forgiven you, so must you also do.<br>

And over all these put on love, <br>

that is, the bond of perfection.<br>

And let the peace of Christ control your hearts, <br>

the peace into which you were also called in one body.<br>

And be thankful.<br>

Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly, <br>

as in all wisdom you teach and admonish one another, <br>

singing psalms, hymns, and spiritual songs <br>

with gratitude in your hearts to God.<br>

And whatever you do, in word or in deed, <br>

do everything in the name of the Lord Jesus, <br>

giving thanks to God the Father through him.  <br>

<br>

Wives, be subordinate to your husbands, <br>

as is proper in the Lord.<br>

Husbands, love your wives, <br>

and avoid any bitterness toward them.<br>

Children, obey your parents in everything, <br>

for this is pleasing to the Lord.<br>

Fathers, do not provoke your children, <br>

so they may not become discouraged.<br>

<br>

<br>

OR:<br>

<br>

Brothers and sisters:<br>

heartfelt compassion, kindness, humility, gentleness, and patience,<br>

1 Jn 3:1-2, 21-24<br>

<br>

Beloved:<br>

See what love the Father has bestowed on us<br>

that we may be called the children of God.<br>

And so we are.<br>

The reason the world does not know us<br>

is that it did not know him.<br>

Beloved, we are God’s children now;<br>

what we shall be has not yet been revealed.<br>

We do know that when it is revealed we shall be like him,<br>

for we shall see him as he is.<br>

<br>

Beloved, if our hearts do not condemn us,<br>

we have confidence in God and receive from him whatever we ask,<br>

because we keep his commandments and do what pleases him.<br>

And his commandment is this:<br>

we should believe in the name of his Son, Jesus Christ,<br>

and love one another just as he commanded us.<br>

Those who keep his commandments remain in him, and he in them,<br>

and the way we know that he remains in us<br>

is from the Spirit he gave us.</p>
