  <p>A reading from the holy Gospel according to Mark. <br>

Jesus appeared to the Eleven and said to them:<br>

“Go into the whole world<br>

and proclaim the Gospel to every creature.<br>

Whoever believes and is baptized will be saved;<br>

whoever does not believe will be condemned.<br>

These signs will accompany those who believe:<br>

in my name they will drive out demons,<br>

they will speak new languages.<br>

They will pick up serpents with their hands,<br>

and if they drink any deadly thing, it will not harm them.<br>

They will lay hands on the sick, and they will recover.” </p>
