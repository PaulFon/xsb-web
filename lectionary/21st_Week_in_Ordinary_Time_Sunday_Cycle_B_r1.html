  <p>Joshua gathered together all the tribes of Israel at Shechem,<br>

summoning their elders, their leaders,<br>

their judges, and their officers. <br>

When they stood in ranks before God,<br>

Joshua addressed all the people:<br>

“If it does not please you to serve the LORD,<br>

decide today whom you will serve,<br>

the gods your fathers served beyond the River<br>

or the gods of the Amorites in whose country you are now dwelling. <br>

As for me and my household, we will serve the LORD.”<br>

<br>

But the people answered,<br>

“Far be it from us to forsake the LORD<br>

for the service of other gods. <br>

For it was the LORD, our God,<br>

who brought us and our fathers up out of the land of Egypt,<br>

out of a state of slavery. <br>

He performed those great miracles before our very eyes<br>

and protected us along our entire journey<br>

and among the peoples through whom we passed. <br>

Therefore we also will serve the LORD, for he is our God.”</p>
