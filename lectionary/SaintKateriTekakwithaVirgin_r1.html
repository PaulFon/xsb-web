<div class="poetry">
<p>In the days of Ahaz, king of Judah, son of Jotham, son of Uzziah,<br />
Rezin, king of Aram,<br />
and Pekah, king of Israel, son of Remaliah,<br />
went up to attack Jerusalem,<br />
but they were not able to conquer it.<br />
When word came to the house of David that Aram<br />
was encamped in Ephraim,<br />
the heart of the king and the heart of the people trembled,<br />
as the trees of the forest tremble in the wind.</p>
<p>Then the LORD said to Isaiah: Go out to meet Ahaz,<br />
you and your son Shear-jashub,<br />
at the end of the conduit of the upper pool,<br />
on the highway of the fuller’s field, and say to him:<br />
Take care you remain tranquil and do not fear;<br />
let not your courage fail<br />
before these two stumps of smoldering brands<br />
the blazing anger of Rezin and the Arameans,<br />
and of the son Remaliah,<br />
because of the mischief that<br />
Aram, Ephraim and the son of Remaliah,<br />
plots against you, saying,<br />
“Let us go up and tear Judah asunder, make it our own by force,<br />
and appoint the son of Tabeel king there.”</p>
<p>Thus says the LORD:<br />
This shall not stand, it shall not be!<br />
Damascus is the capital of Aram,<br />
and Rezin is the head of Damascus;<br />
Samaria is the capital of Ephraim,<br />
and Remaliah’s son the head of Samaria.</p>
<p>But within sixty years and five,<br />
Ephraim shall be crushed, no longer a nation.<br />
Unless your faith is firm<br />
you shall not be firm!</p>
