  <p>Let us pray.<br>

Grant, almighty God,<br>

through the yearly observances of holy Lent,<br>

that we may grow in understanding<br>

of the riches hidden in Christ<br>

and by worthy conduct pursue their effects.<br>

<br>

Through our Lord Jesus Christ, your Son,<br>

who lives and reigns with you in the unity of the Holy Spirit,<br>

one God, for ever and ever.</p>
