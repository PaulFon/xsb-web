  <p>A reading from the First Letter of Saint Paul to the Corinthians: <br>

Brothers and sisters:<br>

As a body is one though it has many parts,<br>

and all the parts of the body, though many, are one body,<br>

so also Christ.<br>

For in one Spirit we were all baptized into one body,<br>

whether Jews or Greeks, slaves or free persons,<br>

and we were all given to drink of one Spirit.<br>

<br>

Now the body is not a single part, but many.<br>

If a foot should say,<br>

“Because I am not a hand I do not belong to the body, “<br>

it does not for this reason belong any less to the body.<br>

Or if an ear should say,<br>

“Because I am not an eye I do not belong to the body, “<br>

it does not for this reason belong any less to the body.<br>

If the whole body were an eye, where would the hearing be?<br>

If the whole body were hearing, where would the sense of smell be?<br>

But as it is, God placed the parts,<br>

each one of them, in the body as he intended.<br>

If they were all one part, where would the body be?<br>

But as it is, there are many parts, yet one body.<br>

The eye cannot say to the hand, “I do not need you, “<br>

nor again the head to the feet, “I do not need you.”<br>

Indeed, the parts of the body that seem to be weaker<br>

are all the more necessary,<br>

and those parts of the body that we consider less honorable<br>

we surround with greater honor,<br>

and our less presentable parts are treated with greater propriety,<br>

whereas our more presentable parts do not need this.<br>

But God has so constructed the body<br>

as to give greater honor to a part that is without it,<br>

so that there may be no division in the body,<br>

but that the parts may have the same concern for one another.<br>

If one part suffers, all the parts suffer with it;<br>

if one part is honored, all the parts share its joy.<br>

<br>

Now you are Christ’s body, and individually parts of it.<br>

Some people God has designated in the church<br>

to be, first, apostles; second, prophets; third, teachers;<br>

then, mighty deeds;<br>

then gifts of healing, assistance, administration,<br>

and varieties of tongues.<br>

Are all apostles? Are all prophets? Are all teachers?<br>

Do all work mighty deeds? Do all have gifts of healing?<br>

Do all speak in tongues? Do all interpret?<br>

<br>

OR:<br>

Brothers and sisters:<br>

As a body is one though it has many parts,<br>

and all the parts of the body, though many, are one body,<br>

so also Christ.<br>

For in one Spirit we were all baptized into one body,<br>

whether Jews or Greeks, slaves or free persons,<br>

and we were all given to drink of one Spirit.<br>

Now the body is not a single part, but many.<br>

You are Christ’s body, and individually parts of it.</p>
