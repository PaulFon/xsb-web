  <p>A reading from the holy Gospel according to John. <br>

Jesus said to the crowds:<br>

“Everything that the Father gives me will come to me,<br>

and I will not reject anyone who comes to me,<br>

because I came down from heaven not to do my own will<br>

but the will of the one who sent me.<br>

And this is the will of the one who sent me,<br>

that I should not lose anything of what he gave me,<br>

but that I should raise it on the last day.<br>

For this is the will of my Father,<br>

that everyone who sees the Son and believes in him<br>

may have eternal life,<br>

and I shall raise him on the last day.”</p>
