  <p>A reading from the holy Gospel <br class="sline">
    according to Matthew. <br class="sline">
    R. Glory to you, O Lord. </p>
    <p>At that time, Jesus withdrew <br class="sline">
      to the region of Tyre and Sidon.  <br class="sline">
      And behold, a Canaanite woman of that district <br class="sline">
      came and called out, <br class="sline">
      "Have pity on me, Lord, Son of David!  <br class="sline">
      My daughter is tormented by a demon." <br class="sline">
      But Jesus did not say a word in answer to her.  <br class="sline">
      Jesus' disciples came and asked him, <br class="sline">
      "Send her away, for she keeps <br class="sline">
      calling out after us." <br class="sline">
      He said in reply, <br class="sline">
      "I was sent only to the lost sheep <br class="sline">
      of the house of Israel." <br class="sline">
      But the woman came and did Jesus homage, <br class="sline">
      saying, "Lord, help me." <br class="sline">
      He said in reply, <br class="sline">
      "It is not right to take the food <br class="sline">
      of the children and throw it to the dogs."  <br class="sline">
      She said, <br class="sline">
      "Please, Lord, for even the dogs <br class="sline">
      eat the scraps that fall <br class="sline">
      from the table of their masters."  <br class="sline">
      Then Jesus said to her in reply, <br class="sline">
      "O woman, great is your faith!  <br class="sline">
      Let it be done for you as you wish."  <br class="sline">
      And the woman's daughter was <br class="sline">
      healed from that hour.
    </p>The Gospel of the Lord. <br class="sline">
    R. Praise to you, Lord Jesus Christ.</p>
