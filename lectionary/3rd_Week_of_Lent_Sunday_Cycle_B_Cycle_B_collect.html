  <p>O God, author of every mercy and of all goodness, <br>
who in fasting, prayer and almsgiving <br>
have shown us a remedy for sin, <br>
look graciously on this confession of our lowliness, <br>
that we, who are bowed down by our conscience, <br>
may always be lifted up by your mercy. <br>
Through our Lord Jesus Christ, your Son, <br>
who lives and reigns with you in the unity of the Holy Spirit, <br>
God, for ever and ever. R. Amen.</p>
