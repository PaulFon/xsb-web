<div class="poetry">
<p>On that day, Jesus went out of the house and sat down by the sea.<br />
Such large crowds gathered around him<br />
that he got into a boat and sat down,<br />
and the whole crowd stood along the shore.<br />
And he spoke to them at length in parables, saying:<br />
“A sower went out to sow.<br />
And as he sowed, some seed fell on the path,<br />
and birds came and ate it up.<br />
Some fell on rocky ground, where it had little soil.<br />
It sprang up at once because the soil was not deep,<br />
and when the sun rose it was scorched,<br />
and it withered for lack of roots.<br />
Some seed fell among thorns, and the thorns grew up and choked it.<br />
But some seed fell on rich soil, and produced fruit,<br />
a hundred or sixty or thirtyfold.<br />
Whoever has ears ought to hear.”</p>
<p>The disciples approached him and said,<br />
“Why do you speak to them in parables?”<br />
He said to them in reply,<br />
“Because knowledge of the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven<br />
has been granted to you, but to them it has not been granted.<br />
To anyone who has, more will be given and he will grow rich;<br />
from anyone who has not, even what he has will be taken away.<br />
This is why I speak to them in parables, because<br />
<em>they look but do not see and hear but do not listen or understand.</em><br />
Isaiah’s prophecy is fulfilled in them, which says:<br />
<em>You shall indeed hear but not understand,<br />
you shall indeed look but never see.<br />
Gross is the heart of this people,<br />
they will hardly hear with their ears,<br />
they have closed their eyes,<br />
lest they see with their eyes<br />
and hear with their ears<br />
and understand with their hearts and be converted,<br />
and I heal them.</em></p>
<p>“But blessed are your eyes, because they see,<br />
and your ears, because they hear.<br />
Amen, I say to you, many prophets and righteous people<br />
longed to see what you see but did not see it,<br />
and to hear what you hear but did not hear it.</p>
<p>“Hear then the parable of the sower.<br />
The seed sown on the path is the one<br />
who hears the word of the kingdom without understanding it,<br />
and the evil one comes and steals away<br />
what was sown in his heart.<br />
The seed sown on rocky ground<br />
is the one who hears the word and receives it at once with joy.<br />
But he has no root and lasts only for a time.<br />
When some tribulation or persecution comes because of the word,<br />
he immediately falls away.<br />
The seed sown among thorns is the one who hears the word,<br />
but then worldly anxiety and the lure of riches choke the word<br />
and it bears no fruit.<br />
But the seed sown on rich soil<br />
is the one who hears the word and understands it,<br />
who indeed bears fruit and yields a hundred or sixty or thirtyfold.”</p>
