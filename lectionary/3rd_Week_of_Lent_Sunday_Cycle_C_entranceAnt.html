  <p>My eyes are always on the Lord, <br>

for he rescues my feet from the snare. <br>

Turn to me and have mercy on me, <br>

for I am alone and poor.<br>

Or: <br>

When I prove my holiness among you, <br>

I will gather you from all the foreign lands; <br>

and I will pour clean water upon you <br>

and cleanse you from all your impurities, <br>

and I will give you a new spirit, says the Lord.</p>
