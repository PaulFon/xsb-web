  <p>A reading from the second letter of <br>

Paul to the Corinthians<br>

Brothers and sisters:<br>

Whoever is in Christ is a new creation:<br>

the old things have passed away;<br>

behold, new things have come.<br>

And all this is from God,<br>

who has reconciled us to himself through Christ<br>

and given us the ministry of reconciliation,<br>

namely, God was reconciling the world to himself in Christ,<br>

not counting their trespasses against them<br>

and entrusting to us the message of reconciliation.<br>

So we are ambassadors for Christ,<br>

as if God were appealing through us.<br>

We implore you on behalf of Christ,<br>

be reconciled to God.<br>

For our sake he made him to be sin who did not know sin,<br>

so that we might become the righteousness of God in him.</p>
