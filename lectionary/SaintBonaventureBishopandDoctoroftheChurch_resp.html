<div class="poetry">
<p>R. (14a) <strong>The Lord will not abandon his people.</strong><br />
Your people, O LORD, they trample down,<br />
your inheritance they afflict.<br />
Widow and stranger they slay,<br />
the fatherless they murder.<br />
R. <strong>The Lord will not abandon his people.</strong><br />
And they say, “The LORD sees not;<br />
the God of Jacob perceives not.”<br />
Understand, you senseless ones among the people;<br />
and, you fools, when will you be wise?<br />
R. <strong>The Lord will not abandon his people.</strong><br />
Shall he who shaped the ear not hear?<br />
or he who formed the eye not see?<br />
Shall he who instructs nations not chastise,<br />
he who teaches men knowledge?<br />
R. <strong>The Lord will not abandon his people.</strong><br />
For the LORD will not cast off his people,<br />
nor abandon his inheritance;<br />
But judgment shall again be with justice,<br />
and all the upright of heart shall follow it.<br />
R. <strong>The Lord will not abandon his people.</strong></p>
