  <p>A reading from the First Letter of Saint Paul to the Corinthians: <br>

Brothers and sisters:<br>

You are God’s building.<br>

According to the grace of God given to me,<br>

like a wise master builder I laid a foundation,<br>

and another is building upon it.<br>

But each one must be careful how he builds upon it,<br>

for no one can lay a foundation other than the one that is there,<br>

namely, Jesus Christ.<br>

<br>

Do you not know that you are the temple of God,<br>

and that the Spirit of God dwells in you?<br>

If anyone destroys God’s temple,<br>

God will destroy that person;<br>

for the temple of God, which you are, is holy.</p>
