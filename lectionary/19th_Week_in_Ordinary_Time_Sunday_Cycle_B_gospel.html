  <p>The Jews murmured about Jesus because he said,<br>

“I am the bread that came down from heaven, ”<br>

and they said,<br>

“Is this not Jesus, the son of Joseph? <br>

Do we not know his father and mother? <br>

Then how can he say,<br>

‘I have come down from heaven’?” <br>

Jesus answered and said to them,<br>

“Stop murmuring among yourselves. <br>

No one can come to me unless the Father who sent me draw him,<br>

and I will raise him on the last day. <br>

It is written in the prophets:<br>

They shall all be taught by God.<br>

Everyone who listens to my Father and learns from him comes to me. <br>

Not that anyone has seen the Father<br>

except the one who is from God;<br>

he has seen the Father. <br>

Amen, amen, I say to you,<br>

whoever believes has eternal life. <br>

I am the bread of life. <br>

Your ancestors ate the manna in the desert, but they died;<br>

this is the bread that comes down from heaven<br>

so that one may eat it and not die. <br>

I am the living bread that came down from heaven;<br>

whoever eats this bread will live forever;<br>

and the bread that I will give is my flesh for the life of the world.”</p>
