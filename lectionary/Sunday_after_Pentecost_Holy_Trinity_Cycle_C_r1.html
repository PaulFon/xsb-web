  <p>Thus says the wisdom of God:<br>

 "The LORD possessed me, the beginning of his ways,<br>

  the forerunner of his prodigies of long ago;<br>

 from of old I was poured forth,<br>

 at the first, before the earth.<br>

When there were no depths I was brought forth,<br>

 when there were no fountains or springs of water;<br>

  before the mountains were settled into place,<br>

before the hills, I was brought forth;<br>

while as yet the earth and fields were not made,<br>

nor the first clods of the world.<br>

 "When the Lord established the heavens I was there,<br>

  when he marked out the vault over the face of the deep;<br>

  when he made firm the skies above,<br>

 when he fixed fast the foundations of the earth;<br>

 when he set for the sea its limit,<br>

so that the waters should not transgress his command;<br>

then was I beside him as his craftsman,<br>

and I was his delight day by day,<br>

playing before him all the while,<br>

playing on the surface of his earth;<br>

and I found delight in the human race."</p>
