  <p>A reading from the Book of the Prophet Isaiah:<br>

The LORD was pleased<br>

    to crush him in infirmity.<br>

<br>

If he gives his life as an offering for sin,<br>

    he shall see his descendants in a long life,<br>

    and the will of the LORD shall be accomplished through him.<br>

<br>

Because of his affliction<br>

    he shall see the light in fullness<br>

        of days;<br>

through his suffering, my servant shall justify many,<br>

    and their guilt he shall bear.</p>
