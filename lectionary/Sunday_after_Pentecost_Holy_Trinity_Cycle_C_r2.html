  <p>A reading from the letter of Paul to the Romans<br>

Brothers and sisters:<br>

Therefore, since we have been justified by faith,<br>

we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ,<br>

through whom we have gained access by faith<br>

to this grace in which we stand,<br>

and we boast in hope of the glory of God.<br>

Not only that, but we even boast of our afflictions,<br>

knowing that affliction produces endurance,<br>

and endurance, proven character,<br>

and proven character, hope,<br>

and hope does not disappoint,<br>

because the love of God has been poured out into our hearts<br>

through the Holy Spirit that has been given to us.</p>
