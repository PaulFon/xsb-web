  <p>R. Create a Clean Heart in Me, O God. <br>
Have mercy on me, O God, in your goodness; <br>
in the greatness of your compassion wipe out my offense. <br>
Thoroughly wash me from my guilt <br>
and of my sin cleanse me. <br>
R. Create a clean heart in me, O God. <br>
A clean heart create for me, O God, <br>
and a steadfast spirit renew within me. <br>
Cast me not out from your presence, <br>
and your Holy Spirit take not from me. <br>
R. Create a clean heart in me, O God. <br>
Give me back the joy of your salvation, <br>
and a willing spirit sustain in me. <br>
I will teach transgressors your ways, <br>
and sinners shall return to you. <br>
R. Create a clean heart in me, O God.</p>
