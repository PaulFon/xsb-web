  <p>A reading from the Book of the Prophet Isaiah:<br>

See, the LORD proclaims<br>

        to the ends of the earth:<br>

    say to daughter Zion,<br>

        your savior comes!<br>

    Here is his reward with him,<br>

        his recompense before him.<br>

    They shall be called the holy people,<br>

        the redeemed of the LORD,<br>

    and you shall be called “Frequented,”<br>

        a city that is not forsaken.</p>
