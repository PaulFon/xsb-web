  <p>Christ Jesus, though he was in the form of God,<br>

did not regard equality with God<br>

            something to be grasped.<br>

Rather, he emptied himself,<br>

            taking the form of a slave,<br>

            coming in human likeness;<br>

            and found human in appearance,<br>

            he humbled himself,<br>

            becoming obedient to the point of death,<br>

            even death on a cross.<br>

Because of this, God greatly exalted him<br>

            and bestowed on him the name<br>

            which is above every name,<br>

            that at the name of Jesus<br>

            every knee should bend,<br>

            of those in heaven and on earth and under the earth,<br>

 and every tongue confess that<br>

 Jesus Christ is Lord,<br>

 to the glory of God the Father.</p>
