  <p>A reading from the Letter of Saint Paul to the Ephesians: <br>

Brothers and sisters:<br>

You have heard of the stewardship of God’s grace <br>

that was given to me for your benefit, <br>

namely, that the mystery was made known to me by revelation.<br>

It was not made known to people in other generations <br>

as it has now been revealed<br>

to his holy apostles and prophets by the Spirit: <br>

that the Gentiles are coheirs, members of the same body,<br>

and copartners in the promise in Christ Jesus through the gospel.</p>
