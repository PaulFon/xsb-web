  <p>Gospel: Mt.14:22-33 </p>
<p>A reading from the holy Gospel according to Matthew.<br class="sline"> R. Glory to you, O Lord. </p>
<p>After he had fed the people, <br class="sline">
    Jesus made the disciples get <br class="sline">
    into a boat and precede him to the other side, <br class="sline">
    while he dismissed the crowds. <br class="sline">
    After doing so, he went up on the mountain by himself to pray. <br class="sline">
    When it was evening he was there alone. <br class="sline">
    Meanwhile the boat, already a few miles offshore, <br class="sline">
    was being tossed about by the waves, <br class="sline">
    for the wind was against it. <br class="sline">
    During the fourth watch of the night, <br class="sline">
    he came toward them walking on the sea. <br class="sline">
    When the disciples saw him walking on the sea <br class="sline">
    they were terrified. <br class="sline">
    "It is a ghost," they said, and they cried out in fear. <br class="sline">
    At once Jesus spoke to them, <br class="sline">
    "Take courage, it is I; do not be afraid." <br class="sline">
    Peter said to him in reply, <br class="sline">
    "Lord, if it is you, command me to come to you on the water." <br class="sline">
    He said, "Come."  <br class="sline">
    Peter got out of the boat and <br class="sline">
    began to walk on the water toward Jesus. <br class="sline">
    But when he saw how strong the wind was he became frightened; <br class="sline">
    and, beginning to sink, he cried out, "Lord, save me!" <br class="sline">
    Immediately Jesus stretched out his hand and caught Peter, <br class="sline">
    and said to him, "O you of little faith, why did you doubt?" <br class="sline">
    After they got into the boat, the wind died down. <br class="sline">
    Those who were in the boat did him homage, saying, <br class="sline">
    "Truly, you are the Son of God."</p>
