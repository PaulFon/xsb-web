  <p>A reading from the Letter of Saint Paul to the Hebrews:<br>

Brothers and sisters:<br>

He "for a little while" was made "lower than the angels, "<br>

that by the grace of God he might taste death for everyone.<br>

<br>

For it was fitting that he,<br>

for whom and through whom all things exist,<br>

in bringing many children to glory,<br>

should make the leader to their salvation perfect through suffering.<br>

He who consecrates and those who are being consecrated<br>

all have one origin.<br>

Therefore, he is not ashamed to call them “brothers.”</p>
