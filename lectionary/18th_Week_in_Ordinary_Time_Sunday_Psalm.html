  <p>Ps.145:8-9, 15-18—R. The Hand of the Lord Feeds Us; He Answers All Our Needs. The Lord is gracious and merciful, slow to anger and of great kindness. The Lord is good to all and compassionate toward all his works. R. The hand of the Lord feeds us; he answers all our needs. The eyes of all look hopefully to you,  and you give them their food in due season; you open your hand and satisfy the desire of every living thing. R. The hand of the Lord feeds us; he answers all our needs. The Lord is just in all his ways and holy in all his works. The Lord is near to all who call upon him, to all who call upon him in truth. R. The hand of the Lord feeds us; he answers all our needs.</p>
