  <p>A reading from the first Letter of Saint Paul to the Corinthians:<br>

I am reminding you, brothers and sisters,<br>

of the gospel I preached to you,<br>

which you indeed received and in which you also stand.<br>

Through it you are also being saved,<br>

if you hold fast to the word I preached to you,<br>

unless you believed in vain.<br>

For I handed on to you as of first importance what I also received:<br>

that Christ died for our sins<br>

in accordance with the Scriptures;<br>

that he was buried;<br>

that he was raised on the third day<br>

in accordance with the Scriptures;<br>

that he appeared to Cephas, then to the Twelve.<br>

After that, Christ appeared to more<br>

than five hundred brothers at once,<br>

most of whom are still living,<br>

though some have fallen asleep.<br>

After that he appeared to James,<br>

then to all the apostles.<br>

Last of all, as to one born abnormally,<br>

he appeared to me.<br>

For I am the least of the apostles,<br>

not fit to be called an apostle,<br>

because I persecuted the church of God.<br>

But by the grace of God I am what I am,<br>

and his grace to me has not been ineffective.<br>

Indeed, I have toiled harder than all of them;<br>

not I, however, but the grace of God that is with me.<br>

Therefore, whether it be I or they,<br>

so we preach and so you believed.<br>

OR:<br>

Brothers and sisters,<br>

I handed on to you as of first importance what I also received:<br>

that Christ died for our sins<br>

in accordance with the Scriptures;<br>

that he was buried;<br>

that he was raised on the third day<br>

in accordance with the Scriptures; <br>

that he appeared to Cephas, then to the Twelve.<br>

After that, he appeared to more<br>

than five hundred brothers at once,<br>

most of whom are still living,<br>

though some have fallen asleep.<br>

After that he appeared to James,<br>

then to all the apostles.<br>

Last of all, as to one abnormally born,<br>

he appeared to me.<br>

Therefore, whether it be I or they,<br>

so we preach and so you believed. </p>
