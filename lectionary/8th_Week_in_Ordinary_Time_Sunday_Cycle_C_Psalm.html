  <p>R Lord, it is good to give thanks to you.<br>

It is good to give thanks to the LORD,<br>

to sing praise to your name, Most High,<br>

To proclaim your kindness at dawn<br>

and your faithfulness throughout the night.<br>

R Lord, it is good to give thanks to you.<br>

The just one shall flourish like the palm tree,<br>

like a cedar of Lebanon shall he grow.<br>

They that are planted in the house of the LORD<br>

shall flourish in the courts of our God.<br>

R Lord, it is good to give thanks to you.<br>

They shall bear fruit even in old age;<br>

vigorous and sturdy shall they be,<br>

Declaring how just is the LORD,<br>

my rock, in whom there is no wrong.<br>

R Lord, it is good to give thanks to you.</p>
