  <p>A reading from the book of Genesis<br>

The Lord God took Abram outside and said,<br>

“Look up at the sky and count the stars, if you can.<br>

Just so,” he added, “shall your descendants be.”<br>

Abram put his faith in the LORD,<br>

who credited it to him as an act of righteousness.<br>

<br>

He then said to him,<br>

“I am the LORD who brought you from Ur of the Chaldeans<br>

to give you this land as a possession.”<br>

“O Lord GOD,” he asked,<br>

“how am I to know that I shall possess it?”<br>

He answered him,<br>

“Bring me a three-year-old heifer, a three-year-old she-goat,<br>

a three-year-old ram, a turtledove, and a young pigeon.”<br>

Abram brought him all these, split them in two,<br>

and placed each half opposite the other;<br>

but the birds he did not cut up.<br>

Birds of prey swooped down on the carcasses,<br>

but Abram stayed with them.<br>

As the sun was about to set, a trance fell upon Abram,<br>

and a deep, terrifying darkness enveloped him.<br>

<br>

When the sun had set and it was dark,<br>

there appeared a smoking fire pot and a flaming torch,<br>

which passed between those pieces.<br>

It was on that occasion that the LORD made a covenant with Abram,<br>

saying: “To your descendants I give this land,<br>

from the Wadi of Egypt to the Great River, the Euphrates.” </p>
