  <p>Let us pray.<br>

May your people exult for ever, O God,<br>

in renewed youthfulness of spirit,<br>

so that, rejoicing now in the restored glory of our adoption,<br>

we may look forward in confident hope<br>

to the rejoicing of the day of resurrection.<br>

Through our Lord Jesus Christ, your Son,who lives and reigns with you in the unity of the Holy Spirit, <br>

one God, for ever and ever.</p>
