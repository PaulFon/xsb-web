  <p>A reading from the letter of Saint Paul to the Romans: <br class="sline">
    Brothers and sisters: <br class="sline">
    I am speaking to you Gentiles.  <br class="sline">
    Inasmuch as I am the apostle to the Gentiles, <br class="sline">
    I glory in my ministry in order to make my race jealous <br class="sline">
    and thus save some of them.  <br class="sline">
    For if their rejection is the reconciliation of the world, <br class="sline">
    what will their acceptance be but life from the dead? </p>
    <p>For the gifts and the call of God are irrevocable. <br class="sline">
    Just as you once disobeyed God <br class="sline">
    but have now received mercy because of their disobedience, <br class="sline">
    so they have now disobeyed in order that, <br class="sline">
    by virtue of the mercy shown to you, <br class="sline">
    they too may now receive mercy.  <br class="sline">
    For God delivered all to disobedience, <br class="sline">
    that he might have mercy upon all.
  </p>The word of the Lord. <br class="sline">
    R. Thanks be to God.</p>
