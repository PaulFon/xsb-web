<div class="poetry">
<p>Jesus said to his disciples:<br />
“The kingdom of heaven is like a treasure buried in a field,<br />
which a person finds and hides again,<br />
and out of joy goes and sells all that he has and buys that field.<br />
Again, the kingdom of heaven is like a merchant<br />
searching for fine pearls.<br />
When he finds a pearl of great price,<br />
he goes and sells all that he has and buys it.<br />
Again, the kingdom of heaven is like a net thrown into the sea,<br />
which collects fish of every kind.<br />
When it is full they haul it ashore<br />
and sit down to put what is good into buckets.<br />
What is bad they throw away.<br />
Thus it will be at the end of the age.<br />
The angels will go out and separate the wicked from the righteous<br />
and throw them into the fiery furnace,<br />
where there will be wailing and grinding of teeth.</p>
<p>“Do you understand all these things?”<br />
They answered, “Yes.”<br />
And he replied,<br />
“Then every scribe who has been instructed in the kingdom of heaven<br />
is like the head of a household<br />
who brings from his storeroom both the new and the old.”</p>
