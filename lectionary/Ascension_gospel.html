<h3>The Ascension of the Lord<br> Lectionary: 58</h3>

<h4>Gospel <a href="/bible/matthew/28:16">Mt 28:16-20</a></h4>
<div class="poetry">
<p>The eleven disciples went to Galilee,<br>
to the mountain to which Jesus had ordered them.<br>
When they saw him, they worshiped, but they doubted.<br>
Then Jesus approached and said to them,<br>
“All power in heaven and on earth has been given to me.<br>
Go, therefore, and make disciples of all nations,<br>
baptizing them in the name of the Father,<br>
and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit,<br>
teaching them to observe all that I have commanded you.<br>
And behold, I am with you always, until the end of the age.”</p>
