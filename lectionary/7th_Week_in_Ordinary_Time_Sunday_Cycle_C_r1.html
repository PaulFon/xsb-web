  <p>A reading from the First Book of Samuel: <br>

In those days, Saul went down to the desert of Ziph<br>

with three thousand picked men of Israel,<br>

to search for David in the desert of Ziph.<br>

So David and Abishai went among Saul’s soldiers by night<br>

and found Saul lying asleep within the barricade,<br>

with his spear thrust into the ground at his head<br>

and Abner and his men sleeping around him.<br>

Abishai whispered to David:<br>

"God has delivered your enemy into your grasp this day.<br>

Let me nail him to the ground with one thrust of the spear;<br>

I will not need a second thrust!"<br>

But David said to Abishai, "Do not harm him,<br>

for who can lay hands on the LORD’s anointed and remain unpunished?"<br>

So David took the spear and the water jug from their place at Saul’s head,<br>

and they got away without anyone’s seeing or knowing or awakening.<br>

All remained asleep,<br>

because the LORD had put them into a deep slumber.<br>

Going across to an opposite slope,<br>

David stood on a remote hilltop<br>

at a great distance from Abner, son of Ner, and the troops.<br>

He said: "Here is the king’s spear.<br>

Let an attendant come over to get it.<br>

The LORD will reward each man for his justice and faithfulness.<br>

Today, though the LORD delivered you into my grasp,<br>

I would not harm the LORD’s anointed."</p>
