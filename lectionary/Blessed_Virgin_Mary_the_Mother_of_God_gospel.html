  <p>A reading from the holy Gospel according to Luke. R. Glory to you, O Lord.<br>

The shepherds went in haste to Bethlehem and found Mary and Joseph,  <br>

and the infant lying in the manger.<br>

When they saw this,  <br>

they made known the message  <br>

that had been told them about this child.<br>

All who heard it were amazed  <br>

by what had been told them by the shepherds.<br>

And Mary kept all these things,  <br>

reflecting on them in her heart.<br>

Then the shepherds returned,  <br>

glorifying and praising God  <br>

for all they had heard and seen,  <br>

just as it had been told to them.  <br>

<br>

When eight days were completed for his circumcision,  <br>

he was named Jesus, the name given him by the angel  <br>

before he was conceived in the womb.</p>
