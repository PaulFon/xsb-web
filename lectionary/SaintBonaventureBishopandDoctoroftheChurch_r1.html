<div class="poetry">
<p>Thus says the LORD:<br />
Woe to Assyria! My rod in anger,<br />
my staff in wrath.<br />
Against an impious nation I send him,<br />
and against a people under my wrath I order him<br />
To seize plunder, carry off loot,<br />
and tread them down like the mud of the streets.<br />
But this is not what he intends,<br />
nor does he have this in mind;<br />
Rather, it is in his heart to destroy,<br />
to make an end of nations not a few.</p>
<p>For he says:<br />
“By my own power I have done it,<br />
and by my wisdom, for I am shrewd.<br />
I have moved the boundaries of peoples,<br />
their treasures I have pillaged,<br />
and, like a giant, I have put down the enthroned.<br />
My hand has seized like a nest<br />
the riches of nations;<br />
As one takes eggs left alone,<br />
so I took in all the earth;<br />
No one fluttered a wing,<br />
or opened a mouth, or chirped!”</p>
<p>Will the axe boast against him who hews with it?<br />
Will the saw exalt itself above him who wields it?<br />
As if a rod could sway him who lifts it,<br />
or a staff him who is not wood!<br />
Therefore the Lord, the LORD of hosts,<br />
will send among his fat ones leanness,<br />
And instead of his glory there will be kindling<br />
like the kindling of fire.</p>
