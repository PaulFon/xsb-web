<div class="poetry">
<p>When Hezekiah was mortally ill,<br />
the prophet Isaiah, son of Amoz, came and said to him:<br />
“Thus says the LORD: Put your house in order,<br />
for you are about to die; you shall not recover.”<br />
Then Hezekiah turned his face to the wall and prayed to the LORD:</p>
<p>“O LORD, remember how faithfully and wholeheartedly<br />
I conducted myself in your presence,<br />
doing what was pleasing to you!”<br />
And Hezekiah wept bitterly.</p>
<p>Then the word of the LORD came to Isaiah: “Go, tell Hezekiah:<br />
Thus says the LORD, the God of your father David:<br />
I have heard your prayer and seen your tears.<br />
I will heal you: in three days you shall go up to the LORD’s temple;<br />
I will add fifteen years to your life.<br />
I will rescue you and this city from the hand of the king of Assyria;<br />
I will be a shield to this city.”</p>
<p>Isaiah then ordered a poultice of figs to be taken<br />
and applied to the boil, that he might recover.<br />
Then Hezekiah asked,<br />
“What is the sign that I shall go up to the temple of the LORD?”</p>
<p>Isaiah answered:<br />
“This will be the sign for you from the LORD<br />
that he will do what he has promised:<br />
See, I will make the shadow cast by the sun<br />
on the stairway to the terrace of Ahaz<br />
go back the ten steps it has advanced.”<br />
So the sun came back the ten steps it had advanced.</p>
