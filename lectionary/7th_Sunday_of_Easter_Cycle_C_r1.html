  <p>A reading from the Acts of the Apostles<br>

Stephen, filled with the Holy Spirit,<br>

looked up intently to heaven and saw the glory of God<br>

and Jesus standing at the right hand of God,<br>

and Stephen said, “Behold, I see the heavens opened<br>

and the Son of Man standing at the right hand of God.”<br>

But they cried out in a loud voice,<br>

covered their ears, and rushed upon him together.<br>

They threw him out of the city, and began to stone him.<br>

The witnesses laid down their cloaks<br>

at the feet of a young man named Saul.<br>

As they were stoning Stephen, he called out,<br>

“Lord Jesus, receive my spirit.”<br>

Then he fell to his knees and cried out in a loud voice,<br>

“Lord, do not hold this sin against them;”<br>

and when he said this, he fell asleep.</p>
