  <p>When the hour came,<br>

Jesus took his place at table with the apostles.<br>

He said to them,<br>

“I have eagerly desired to eat this Passover with you before I suffer,<br>

for, I tell you, I shall not eat it again<br>

until there is fulfillment in the kingdom of God.”<br>

Then he took a cup, gave thanks, and said,<br>

“Take this and share it among yourselves;<br>

for I tell you that from this time on<br>

I shall not drink of the fruit of the vine<br>

until the kingdom of God comes.”<br>

Then he took the bread, said the blessing,<br>

broke it, and gave it to them, saying,<br>

“This is my body, which will be given for you;<br>

do this in memory of me.”<br>

And likewise the cup after they had eaten, saying,<br>

“This cup is the new covenant in my blood,<br>

which will be shed for you.<br>

<br>

“And yet behold, the hand of the one who is to betray me<br>

is with me on the table;<br>

for the Son of Man indeed goes as it has been determined;<br>

but woe to that man by whom he is betrayed.”<br>

And they began to debate among themselves<br>

who among them would do such a deed.<br>

<br>

Then an argument broke out among them<br>

about which of them should be regarded as the greatest.<br>

He said to them,<br>

“The kings of the Gentiles lord it over them<br>

and those in authority over them are addressed as ‘Benefactors’;<br>

but among you it shall not be so.<br>

Rather, let the greatest among you be as the youngest,<br>

and the leader as the servant.<br>

For who is greater:<br>

the one seated at table or the one who serves?<br>

Is it not the one seated at table?<br>

I am among you as the one who serves.<br>

It is you who have stood by me in my trials;<br>

and I confer a kingdom on you,<br>

just as my Father has conferred one on me,<br>

that you may eat and drink at my table in my kingdom;<br>

and you will sit on thrones<br>

judging the twelve tribes of Israel.<br>

<br>

“Simon, Simon, behold Satan has demanded<br>

to sift all of you like wheat,<br>

but I have prayed that your own faith may not fail;<br>

and once you have turned back,<br>

you must strengthen your brothers.”<br>

He said to him,<br>

“Lord, I am prepared to go to prison and to die with you.”<br>

But he replied,<br>

“I tell you, Peter, before the cock crows this day,<br>

you will deny three times that you know me.”<br>

<br>

He said to them,<br>

“When I sent you forth without a money bag or a sack or sandals,<br>

were you in need of anything?”<br>

“No, nothing, “ they replied.<br>

He said to them,<br>

“But now one who has a money bag should take it,<br>

and likewise a sack,<br>

and one who does not have a sword<br>

should sell his cloak and buy one.<br>

For I tell you that this Scripture must be fulfilled in me,<br>

namely, He was counted among the wicked;<br>

and indeed what is written about me is coming to fulfillment.”<br>

Then they said,<br>

“Lord, look, there are two swords here.”<br>

But he replied, “It is enough!”<br>

<br>

Then going out, he went, as was his custom, to the Mount of Olives,<br>

and the disciples followed him.<br>

When he arrived at the place he said to them,<br>

“Pray that you may not undergo the test.”<br>

After withdrawing about a stone’s throw from them and kneeling,<br>

he prayed, saying, “Father, if you are willing,<br>

take this cup away from me;<br>

still, not my will but yours be done.”<br>

And to strengthen him an angel from heaven appeared to him.<br>

He was in such agony and he prayed so fervently<br>

that his sweat became like drops of blood<br>

falling on the ground.<br>

When he rose from prayer and returned to his disciples,<br>

he found them sleeping from grief.<br>

He said to them, “Why are you sleeping?<br>

Get up and pray that you may not undergo the test.”<br>

<br>

While he was still speaking, a crowd approached<br>

and in front was one of the Twelve, a man named Judas.<br>

He went up to Jesus to kiss him.<br>

Jesus said to him,<br>

“Judas, are you betraying the Son of Man with a kiss?”<br>

His disciples realized what was about to happen, and they asked,<br>

“Lord, shall we strike with a sword?”<br>

And one of them struck the high priest’s servant<br>

and cut off his right ear.<br>

But Jesus said in reply,<br>

“Stop, no more of this!”<br>

Then he touched the servant’s ear and healed him.<br>

And Jesus said to the chief priests and temple guards<br>

and elders who had come for him,<br>

“Have you come out as against a robber, with swords and clubs?<br>

Day after day I was with you in the temple area,<br>

and you did not seize me;<br>

but this is your hour, the time for the power of darkness.”<br>

<br>

After arresting him they led him away<br>

and took him into the house of the high priest;<br>

Peter was following at a distance.<br>

They lit a fire in the middle of the courtyard and sat around it,<br>

and Peter sat down with them.<br>

When a maid saw him seated in the light,<br>

she looked intently at him and said,<br>

“This man too was with him.”<br>

But he denied it saying,<br>

“Woman, I do not know him.”<br>

A short while later someone else saw him and said,<br>

“You too are one of them”;<br>

but Peter answered, “My friend, I am not.”<br>

About an hour later, still another insisted,<br>

“Assuredly, this man too was with him,<br>

for he also is a Galilean.”<br>

But Peter said,<br>

“My friend, I do not know what you are talking about.”<br>

Just as he was saying this, the cock crowed,<br>

and the Lord turned and looked at Peter;<br>

and Peter remembered the word of the Lord,<br>

how he had said to him,<br>

“Before the cock crows today, you will deny me three times.”<br>

He went out and began to weep bitterly.<br>

The men who held Jesus in custody were ridiculing and beating him.<br>

They blindfolded him and questioned him, saying,<br>

“Prophesy!  Who is it that struck you?”<br>

And they reviled him in saying many other things against him.<br>

<br>

When day came the council of elders of the people met,<br>

both chief priests and scribes,<br>

and they brought him before their Sanhedrin.<br>

They said, “If you are the Christ, tell us, “<br>

but he replied to them, “If I tell you, you will not believe,<br>

and if I question, you will not respond.<br>

But from this time on the Son of Man will be seated<br>

at the right hand of the power of God.”<br>

They all asked, “Are you then the Son of God?”<br>

He replied to them, “You say that I am.”<br>

Then they said, “What further need have we for testimony?<br>

We have heard it from his own mouth.”<br>

<br>

Then the whole assembly of them arose and brought him before Pilate.<br>

They brought charges against him, saying,<br>

“We found this man misleading our people;<br>

he opposes the payment of taxes to Caesar<br>

and maintains that he is the Christ, a king.”<br>

Pilate asked him, “Are you the king of the Jews?”<br>

He said to him in reply, “You say so.”<br>

Pilate then addressed the chief priests and the crowds,<br>

“I find this man not guilty.”<br>

But they were adamant and said,<br>

“He is inciting the people with his teaching throughout all Judea,<br>

from Galilee where he began even to here.”<br>

<br>

On hearing this Pilate asked if the man was a Galilean;<br>

and upon learning that he was under Herod’s jurisdiction,<br>

he sent him to Herod who was in Jerusalem at that time.<br>

Herod was very glad to see Jesus;<br>

he had been wanting to see him for a long time,<br>

for he had heard about him<br>

and had been hoping to see him perform some sign.<br>

He questioned him at length,<br>

but he gave him no answer.<br>

The chief priests and scribes, meanwhile,<br>

stood by accusing him harshly.<br>

Herod and his soldiers treated him contemptuously and mocked him,<br>

and after clothing him in resplendent garb,<br>

he sent him back to Pilate.<br>

Herod and Pilate became friends that very day,<br>

even though they had been enemies formerly.<br>

Pilate then summoned the chief priests, the rulers, and the people<br>

and said to them, “You brought this man to me<br>

and accused him of inciting the people to revolt.<br>

I have conducted my investigation in your presence<br>

and have not found this man guilty<br>

of the charges you have brought against him,<br>

nor did Herod, for he sent him back to us.<br>

So no capital crime has been committed by him.<br>

Therefore I shall have him flogged and then release him.”<br>

<br>

But all together they shouted out,<br>

“Away with this man!<br>

Release Barabbas to us.”<br>

— Now Barabbas had been imprisoned for a rebellion<br>

that had taken place in the city and for murder. —<br>

Again Pilate addressed them, still wishing to release Jesus,<br>

but they continued their shouting,<br>

“Crucify him!  Crucify him!”<br>

Pilate addressed them a third time,<br>

“What evil has this man done?<br>

I found him guilty of no capital crime.<br>

Therefore I shall have him flogged and then release him.”<br>

With loud shouts, however,<br>

they persisted in calling for his crucifixion,<br>

and their voices prevailed.<br>

The verdict of Pilate was that their demand should be granted.<br>

So he released the man who had been imprisoned<br>

for rebellion and murder, for whom they asked,<br>

and he handed Jesus over to them to deal with as they wished.<br>

<br>

As they led him away<br>

they took hold of a certain Simon, a Cyrenian,<br>

who was coming in from the country;<br>

and after laying the cross on him,<br>

they made him carry it behind Jesus.<br>

A large crowd of people followed Jesus,<br>

including many women who mourned and lamented him.<br>

Jesus turned to them and said,<br>

“Daughters of Jerusalem, do not weep for me;<br>

weep instead for yourselves and for your children<br>

for indeed, the days are coming when people will say,<br>

‘Blessed are the barren,<br>

the wombs that never bore<br>

and the breasts that never nursed.’<br>

At that time people will say to the mountains,<br>

‘Fall upon us!’<br>

and to the hills, ‘Cover us!’<br>

for if these things are done when the wood is green<br>

what will happen when it is dry?”<br>

Now two others, both criminals,<br>

were led away with him to be executed.<br>

<br>

When they came to the place called the Skull,<br>

they crucified him and the criminals there,<br>

one on his right, the other on his left.<br>

Then Jesus said,<br>

“Father, forgive them, they know not what they do.”<br>

They divided his garments by casting lots.<br>

The people stood by and watched;<br>

the rulers, meanwhile, sneered at him and said,<br>

“He saved others, let him save himself<br>

if he is the chosen one, the Christ of God.”<br>

Even the soldiers jeered at him.<br>

As they approached to offer him wine they called out,<br>

“If you are King of the Jews, save yourself.”<br>

Above him there was an inscription that read,<br>

“This is the King of the Jews.”<br>

<br>

Now one of the criminals hanging there reviled Jesus, saying,<br>

“Are you not the Christ?<br>

Save yourself and us.”<br>

The other, however, rebuking him, said in reply,<br>

“Have you no fear of God,<br>

for you are subject to the same condemnation?<br>

And indeed, we have been condemned justly,<br>

for the sentence we received corresponds to our crimes,<br>

but this man has done nothing criminal.”<br>

Then he said,<br>

“Jesus, remember me when you come into your kingdom.”<br>

He replied to him,<br>

“Amen, I say to you,<br>

today you will be with me in Paradise.”<br>

<br>

It was now about noon and darkness came over the whole land<br>

until three in the afternoon<br>

because of an eclipse of the sun.<br>

Then the veil of the temple was torn down the middle.<br>

Jesus cried out in a loud voice,<br>

“Father, into your hands I commend my spirit”;<br>

and when he had said this he breathed his last.<br>

<br>

Here all kneel and pause for a short time.<br>

<br>

The centurion who witnessed what had happened glorified God and said,<br>

“This man was innocent beyond doubt.”<br>

When all the people who had gathered for this spectacle saw what had happened,<br>

they returned home beating their breasts;<br>

but all his acquaintances stood at a distance,<br>

including the women who had followed him from Galilee<br>

and saw these events.<br>

Now there was a virtuous and righteous man named Joseph who,<br>

though he was a member of the council,<br>

had not consented to their plan of action.<br>

He came from the Jewish town of Arimathea<br>

and was awaiting the kingdom of God.<br>

He went to Pilate and asked for the body of Jesus.<br>

After he had taken the body down,<br>

he wrapped it in a linen cloth<br>

and laid him in a rock-hewn tomb<br>

in which no one had yet been buried.<br>

It was the day of preparation,<br>

and the sabbath was about to begin.<br>

The women who had come from Galilee with him followed behind,<br>

and when they had seen the tomb<br>

and the way in which his body was laid in it,<br>

they returned and prepared spices and perfumed oils.<br>

Then they rested on the sabbath according to the commandment.<br>

<br>

Or<br>

Lk 23:1-49<br>

<br>

The elders of the people, chief priests and scribes,<br>

arose and brought Jesus before Pilate.<br>

They brought charges against him, saying,<br>

“We found this man misleading our people;<br>

he opposes the payment of taxes to Caesar<br>

and maintains that he is the Christ, a king.”<br>

Pilate asked him, “Are you the king of the Jews?”<br>

He said to him in reply, “You say so.”<br>

Pilate then addressed the chief priests and the crowds,<br>

“I find this man not guilty.”<br>

But they were adamant and said,<br>

“He is inciting the people with his teaching throughout all Judea,<br>

from Galilee where he began even to here.”<br>
