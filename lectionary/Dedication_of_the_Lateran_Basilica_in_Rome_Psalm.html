  <p>R.    (5) The waters of the river gladden the city of God, the holy dwelling of the Most High!<br>

God is our refuge and our strength,<br>

    an ever-present help in distress.<br>

Therefore, we fear not, though the earth be shaken<br>

    and mountains plunge into the depths of the sea.<br>

R.    The waters of the river gladden the city of God, the holy dwelling of the Most High!<br>

There is a stream whose runlets gladden the city of God,<br>

    the holy dwelling of the Most High.<br>

God is in its midst; it shall not be disturbed;<br>

    God will help it at the break of dawn.<br>

R.    The waters of the river gladden the city of God, the holy dwelling of the Most High!<br>

The LORD of hosts is with us;<br>

    our stronghold is the God of Jacob.<br>

Come! behold the deeds of the LORD,<br>

    the astounding things he has wrought on earth. <br>

R.    The waters of the river gladden the city of God, the holy dwelling of the Most High!</p>
