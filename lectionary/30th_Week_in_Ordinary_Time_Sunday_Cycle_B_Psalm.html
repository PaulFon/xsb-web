  <p>R. The Lord has done great things for us; we are filled with joy.<br>

When the LORD brought back the captives of Zion,<br>

    we were like men dreaming.<br>

Then our mouth was filled with laughter,<br>

    and our tongue with rejoicing.<br>

R. The Lord has done great things for us; we are filled with joy.<br>

Then they said among the nations,<br>

    "The LORD has done great things for them."<br>

The LORD has done great things for us;<br>

    we are glad indeed.<br>

R. The Lord has done great things for us; we are filled with joy.<br>

Restore our fortunes, O LORD,<br>

    like the torrents in the southern desert.<br>

Those that sow in tears<br>

    shall reap rejoicing.<br>

R. The Lord has done great things for us; we are filled with joy.<br>

Although they go forth weeping,<br>

    carrying the seed to be sown,<br>

They shall come back rejoicing,<br>

    carrying their sheaves.<br>

R. The Lord has done great things for us; we are filled with joy.</p>
