  <p>A reading from the holy Gospel according to Luke. <br>

R. Glory to you, O Lord. <br>

Jesus said to his disciples:<br>

"To you who hear I say,<br>

love your enemies, do good to those who hate you,<br>

bless those who curse you, pray for those who mistreat you.<br>

To the person who strikes you on one cheek,<br>

offer the other one as well,<br>

and from the person who takes your cloak,<br>

do not withhold even your tunic.<br>

Give to everyone who asks of you,<br>

and from the one who takes what is yours do not demand it back.<br>

Do to others as you would have them do to you.<br>

For if you love those who love you,<br>

what credit is that to you?<br>

Even sinners love those who love them.<br>

And if you do good to those who do good to you,<br>

what credit is that to you?<br>

Even sinners do the same.<br>

If you lend money to those from whom you expect repayment,<br>

what credit is that to you?<br>

Even sinners lend to sinners,<br>

and get back the same amount.<br>

But rather, love your enemies and do good to them,<br>

and lend expecting nothing back;<br>

then your reward will be great<br>

and you will be children of the Most High,<br>

for he himself is kind to the ungrateful and the wicked.<br>

Be merciful, just as your Father is merciful.<br>

"Stop judging and you will not be judged.<br>

Stop condemning and you will not be condemned.<br>

Forgive and you will be forgiven.<br>

Give, and gifts will be given to you;<br>

a good measure, packed together, shaken down, and overflowing,<br>

will be poured into your lap.<br>

For the measure with which you measure<br>

will in return be measured out to you."</p>
