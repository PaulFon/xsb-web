  <p>A reading from the letter of Saint Paul to the Ephesians: Brothers and sisters:<br>

Be subordinate to one another out of reverence for Christ. <br>

Wives should be subordinate to their husbands as to the Lord.<br>

For the husband is head of his wife<br>

just as Christ is head of the church,<br>

he himself the savior of the body. <br>

As the church is subordinate to Christ,<br>

so wives should be subordinate to their husbands in everything.<br>

Husbands, love your wives,<br>

even as Christ loved the church<br>

and handed himself over for her to sanctify her,<br>

cleansing her by the bath of water with the word,<br>

that he might present to himself the church in splendor,<br>

without spot or wrinkle or any such thing,<br>

that she might be holy and without blemish. <br>

So also husbands should love their wives as their own bodies. <br>

He who loves his wife loves himself. <br>

For no one hates his own flesh<br>

but rather nourishes and cherishes it, <br>

even as Christ does the church,<br>

because we are members of his body.<br>

    For this reason a man shall leave his father and his mother<br>

        and be joined to his wife,<br>

    and the two shall become one flesh.<br>

This is a great mystery,<br>

but I speak in reference to Christ and the church.<br>

<br>

OR:<br>

<br>

Brothers and sisters:<br>

Live in love, as Christ loved us. <br>

Husbands, love your wives,<br>

even as Christ loved the church<br>

and handed himself over for her to sanctify her,<br>

cleansing her by the bath of water with the word,<br>

that he might present to himself the church in splendor,<br>

without spot or wrinkle or any such thing,<br>

that she might be holy and without blemish. <br>

So also husbands should love their wives as their own bodies. <br>

He who loves his wife loves himself. <br>

For no one hates his own flesh<br>

but rather nourishes and cherishes it, <br>

even as Christ does the church,<br>

because we are members of his body.<br>

    For this reason a man shall leave his father and his mother<br>

        and be joined to his wife,<br>

    and the two shall become one flesh.<br>

This is a great mystery,<br>

but I speak in reference to Christ and the church.</p>
