  <p>R. The Stone Rejected By the Builders Has Become the Cornerstone. Or: R.  Alleluia. Give thanks to the Lord, for he is good, for his mercy endures forever. It is better to take refuge in the Lord than to trust in man. It is better to take refuge in the Lord than to trust in princes. R.  The stone rejected by the builders has become the cornerstone. Or: R. Alleluia. I will give thanks to you, for you have answered me and have been my savior. The stone which the builders rejected has become the cornerstone. By the Lord has this been done; it is wonderful in our eyes. R. The stone rejected by the builders has become the cornerstone. Or: R. Alleluia. Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord; we bless you from the house of the Lord. I will give thanks to you, for you have answered me and have been my savior. Give thanks to the Lord, for he is good; for his kindness endures forever. R. The stone rejected by the builders has become the cornerstone. Or: R. Alleluia.</p>
