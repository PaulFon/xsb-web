      <p>Responsorial Psalm: Ps.85:9, 10-14—</p>
      <p>R. Lord, Let Us See Your Kindness, and Grant Us Your Salvation. </p>
      <p>I will hear what God proclaims; <br class="sline">
      the Lord—for he proclaims peace. <br class="sline">
      Near indeed is his salvation to those who fear him, <br class="sline">
      glory dwelling in our land. </p>
      <p>R. Lord, let us see your kindness, and grant us your salvation. </p>
      <p>Kindness and truth shall meet; <br class="sline">
        justice and peace shall kiss. <br class="sline">
          Truth shall spring out of the earth, <br class="sline">
          and justice shall look down from heaven. </p>
      <p>R. Lord, let us see your kindness, and grant us your salvation. </p>
      <p>The Lord himself will give his benefits; <br class="sline">
          our land shall yield its increase. <br class="sline">
          Justice shall walk before him, <br class="sline">
          and prepare the way of his steps. </p>
      <p>R. Lord, let us see your kindness, and grant us your salvation.</p>
