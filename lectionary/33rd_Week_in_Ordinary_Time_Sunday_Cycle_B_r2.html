  <p>A reading from the Letter of Saint Paul to the Hebrews: <br>

Brothers and sisters:<br>

Every priest stands daily at his ministry,<br>

offering frequently those same sacrifices<br>

that can never take away sins. <br>

But this one offered one sacrifice for sins,<br>

and took his seat forever at the right hand of God;<br>

now he waits until his enemies are made his footstool. <br>

For by one offering<br>

he has made perfect forever those who are being consecrated.<br>

<br>

Where there is forgiveness of these,<br>

there is no longer offering for sin.</p>
