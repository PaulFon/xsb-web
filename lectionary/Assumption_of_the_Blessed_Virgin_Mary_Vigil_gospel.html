  <p>A Reading from the Gospel of Luke.<br>

While Jesus was speaking,<br>

a woman from the crowd called out and said to him,<br>

“Blessed is the womb that carried you<br>

and the breasts at which you nursed.”<br>

He replied,<br>

“Rather, blessed are those<br>

who hear the word of God and observe it.”</p>
