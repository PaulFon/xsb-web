  <p>A reading from the book of Revelation<br>

I, John, heard a voice saying to me:<br>

“Behold, I am coming soon.<br>

I bring with me the recompense I will give to each<br>

according to his deeds.<br>

I am the Alpha and the Omega, the first and the last,<br>

the beginning and the end.”<br>

Blessed are they who wash their robes<br>

so as to have the right to the tree of life<br>

and enter the city through its gates.<br>

“I, Jesus, sent my angel to give you this testimony for the churches.<br>

I am the root and offspring of David,<br>

the bright morning star.”<br>

The Spirit and the bride say, “Come.”<br>

Let the hearer say, “Come.”<br>

Let the one who thirsts come forward,<br>

and the one who wants it receive the gift of life-giving water.<br>

The one who gives this testimony says, “Yes, I am coming soon.”<br>

Amen!  Come, Lord Jesus!</p>
