  <p>A reading from the holy Gospel according to Mark. R. Glory to you, O Lord.  When the Pharisees with some scribes who had come from Jerusalem<br>

gathered around Jesus,<br>

they observed that some of his disciples ate their meals<br>

with unclean, that is, unwashed, hands. <br>

—For the Pharisees and, in fact, all Jews,<br>

do not eat without carefully washing their hands,<br>

keeping the tradition of the elders.<br>

And on coming from the marketplace <br>

they do not eat without purifying themselves. <br>

And there are many other things that they have traditionally observed,<br>

the purification of cups and jugs and kettles and beds. —<br>

So the Pharisees and scribes questioned him,<br>

“Why do your disciples not follow the tradition of the elders<br>

but instead eat a meal with unclean hands?” <br>

He responded,<br>

“Well did Isaiah prophesy about you hypocrites, as it is written:<br>

    This people honors me with their lips,<br>

        but their hearts are far from me;<br>

    in vain do they worship me,<br>

        teaching as doctrines human precepts.<br>

You disregard God’s commandment but cling to human tradition.”<br>

<br>

He summoned the crowd again and said to them,<br>

“Hear me, all of you, and understand. <br>

Nothing that enters one from outside can defile that person;<br>

but the things that come out from within are what defile.<br>

<br>

“From within people, from their hearts,<br>

come evil thoughts, unchastity, theft, murder,<br>

adultery, greed, malice, deceit,<br>

licentiousness, envy, blasphemy, arrogance, folly.<br>

All these evils come from within and they defile.”</p>
