  <p>A reading from the Acts of the Apostles: <br>

Paul addressed the people in these words:<br>

“I am a Jew, born in Tarsus in Cilicia,<br>

but brought up in this city.<br>

At the feet of Gamaliel I was educated strictly in our ancestral law<br>

and was zealous for God, just as all of you are today.<br>

I persecuted this Way to death,<br>

binding both men and women and delivering them to prison.<br>

Even the high priest and the whole council of elders<br>

can testify on my behalf.<br>

For from them I even received letters to the brothers<br>

and set out for Damascus to bring back to Jerusalem<br>

in chains for punishment those there as well.<br>

“On that journey as I drew near to Damascus,<br>

about noon a great light from the sky suddenly shone around me.<br>

I fell to the ground and heard a voice saying to me,<br>

‘Saul, Saul, why are you persecuting me?’<br>

I replied, ‘Who are you, sir?’<br>

And he said to me,<br>

‘I am Jesus the Nazorean whom you are persecuting.’<br>

My companions saw the light<br>

but did not hear the voice of the one who spoke to me.<br>

I asked, ‘What shall I do, sir?’<br>

The Lord answered me, ‘Get up and go into Damascus,<br>

and there you will be told about everything<br>

appointed for you to do.’ <br>

Since I could see nothing because of the brightness of that light,<br>

I was led by hand by my companions and entered Damascus.<br>

“A certain Ananias, a devout observer of the law,<br>

and highly spoken of by all the Jews who lived there,<br>

came to me and stood there and said,<br>

‘Saul, my brother, regain your sight.’<br>

And at that very moment I regained my sight and saw him.<br>

Then he said,<br>

‘The God of our ancestors designated you to know his will,<br>

to see the Righteous One, and to hear the sound of his voice;<br>

for you will be his witness before all<br>

to what you have seen and heard.<br>

Now, why delay?<br>

Get up and have yourself baptized and your sins washed away,<br>

calling upon his name.’”<br>

OR:<br>

Saul, still breathing murderous threats against the disciples of the Lord,<br>

went to the high priest and asked him<br>

for letters to the synagogues in Damascus, that,<br>

if he should find any men or women who belonged to the Way,<br>

he might bring them back to Jerusalem in chains.<br>

On his  journey, as he was nearing Damascus,<br>

a light from the sky suddenly flashed around him.<br>

He fell to the ground and heard a voice saying to him,<br>

“Saul, Saul, why are you persecuting me?”<br>

He said, “Who are you, sir?”<br>

The reply came, “I am Jesus, whom you are persecuting.<br>

Now get up and go into the city and you will be told what you must do.” <br>

The men who were traveling with him stood speechless,<br>

for they heard the voice but could see no one.<br>

Saul got up from the ground,<br>

but when he opened his eyes he could see nothing;<br>

so they led him by the hand and brought him to Damascus.<br>

For three days he was unable to see, and he neither ate nor drank.<br>

There was a disciple in Damascus named Ananias,<br>

and the Lord said to him in a vision, AAnanias.”<br>

He answered, “Here I am, Lord.”<br>

The Lord said to him, “Get up and go to the street called Straight<br>

and ask at the house of Judas for a man from Tarsus named Saul. <br>

He is there praying,<br>

and in a vision he has seen a man named Ananias<br>

come in and lay his hands on him,<br>

that he may regain his sight.”<br>

But Ananias replied,<br>

“Lord, I have heard from many sources about this man,<br>

what evil things he has done to your holy ones in Jerusalem.<br>

And here he has authority from the chief priests<br>

to imprison all who call upon your name.”<br>

But the Lord said to him,<br>

“Go, for this man is a chosen instrument of mine<br>

to carry my name before Gentiles, kings, and children of Israel,<br>

and I will show him what he will have to suffer for my name.”<br>

So Ananias went and entered the house;<br>

laying his hands on him, he said,<br>

“Saul, my brother, the Lord has sent me,<br>

Jesus who appeared to you on the way by which you came,<br>

that you may regain your sight and be filled with the Holy Spirit.”<br>

Immediately things like scales fell from his eyes<br>

and he regained his sight.<br>

He got up and was baptized,<br>

and when he had eaten, he recovered his strength.<br>

He stayed some days with the disciples in Damascus,<br>

and he began at once to proclaim Jesus in the synagogues,<br>

that he is the Son of God.<br>

All who heard him were astounded and said, <br>

“Is not this the man who in Jerusalem<br>

ravaged those who call upon this name,<br>

and came here expressly to take them back in chains<br>

to the chief priests?”<br>

But Saul grew all the stronger<br>

and confounded the Jews who lived in Damascus,<br>

proving that this is the Christ.</p>
