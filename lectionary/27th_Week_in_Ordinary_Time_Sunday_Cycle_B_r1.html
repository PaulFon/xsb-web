  <p>A reading from the book of Genesis<br>

The LORD God said: "It is not good for the man to be alone.<br>

I will make a suitable partner for him."<br>

So the LORD God formed out of the ground<br>

various wild animals and various birds of the air,<br>

and he brought them to the man to see what he would call them;<br>

whatever the man called each of them would be its name. <br>

The man gave names to all the cattle,<br>

all the birds of the air, and all wild animals;<br>

but none proved to be the suitable partner for the man.<br>

So the LORD God cast a deep sleep on the man,<br>

and while he was asleep,<br>

he took out one of his ribs and closed up its place with flesh.<br>

The LORD God then built up into a woman the rib<br>

that he had taken from the man.<br>

When he brought her to the man, the man said:<br>

    "This one, at last, is bone of my bones<br>

        and flesh of my flesh;<br>

    this one shall be called 'woman, '<br>

        for out of 'her man’ this one has been taken."<br>

That is why a man leaves his father and mother<br>

and clings to his wife,<br>

and the two of them become one flesh.</p>
