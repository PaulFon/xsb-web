<div class="poetry">
<p>The Pharisees went out and took counsel against Jesus<br />
to put him to death.</p>
<p>When Jesus realized this, he withdrew from that place.<br />
Many people followed him, and he cured them all,<br />
but he warned them not to make him known.<br />
This was to fulfill what had been spoken through Isaiah the prophet:</p>
<p><em>Behold, my servant whom I have chosen,<br />
my beloved in whom I delight;<br />
I shall place my Spirit upon him,<br />
and he will proclaim justice to the Gentiles.<br />
He will not contend or cry out,<br />
nor will anyone hear his voice in the streets.<br />
A bruised reed he will not break,<br />
a smoldering wick he will not quench,<br />
until he brings justice to victory.</em><br />
<em>And in his name the Gentiles will hope.</em></p>
