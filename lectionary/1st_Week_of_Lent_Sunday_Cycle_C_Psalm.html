  <p>R. (cf. 15b)  Be with me, Lord, when I am in trouble.<br>

You who dwell in the shelter of the Most High,<br>

            who abide in the shadow of the Almighty,<br>

say to the LORD, “My refuge and fortress,<br>

            my God in whom I trust.”<br>

R. Be with me, Lord, when I am in trouble.<br>

No evil shall befall you,<br>

            nor shall affliction come near your tent,<br>

For to his angels he has given command about you,<br>

            that they guard you in all your ways.<br>

R. Be with me, Lord, when I am in trouble.<br>

Upon their hands they shall bear you up,<br>

            lest you dash your foot against a stone.<br>

You shall tread upon the asp and the viper;<br>

            you shall trample down the lion and the dragon.<br>

R. Be with me, Lord, when I am in trouble.<br>

Because he clings to me, I will deliver him;<br>

            I will set him on high because he acknowledges my name.<br>

He shall call upon me, and I will answer him;<br>

            I will be with him in distress;<br>

I will deliver him and glorify him.<br>

R. Be with me, Lord, when I am in trouble.</p>
