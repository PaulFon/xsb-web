  <p>R. (9a) Taste and see the goodness of the Lord.<br>

I will bless the LORD at all times;<br>

    his praise shall be ever in my mouth.<br>

Let my soul glory in the LORD;<br>

    the lowly will hear me and be glad.<br>

R. Taste and see the goodness of the Lord.<br>

Glorify the LORD with me,<br>

       Let us together extol his name.<br>

I sought the LORD, and he answered me<br>

       and delivered me from all my fears.<br>

R. Taste and see the goodness of the Lord.<br>

Look to him that you may be radiant with joy.<br>

       and your faces may not blush with shame.<br>

When the afflicted man called out, the LORD heard,<br>

       and from all his distress he saved him.<br>

R. Taste and see the goodness of the Lord.<br>

The angel of the LORD encamps<br>

       around those who fear him and delivers them.<br>

Taste and see how good the LORD is;<br>

       blessed the man who takes refuge in him.<br>

R. Taste and see the goodness of the Lord.</p>
