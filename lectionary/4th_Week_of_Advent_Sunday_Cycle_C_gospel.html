  <p>A reading from the holy Gospel according to Luke.<br>

Mary set out<br>

and traveled to the hill country in haste<br>

to a town of Judah, <br>

where she entered the house of Zechariah<br>

and greeted Elizabeth.<br>

When Elizabeth heard Mary’s greeting,<br>

the infant leaped in her womb, <br>

and Elizabeth, filled with the Holy Spirit, <br>

cried out in a loud voice and said, <br>

“Blessed are you among women, <br>

and blessed is the fruit of your womb.<br>

And how does this happen to me, <br>

that the mother of my Lord should come to me?<br>

For at the moment the sound of your greeting reached my ears, <br>

the infant in my womb leaped for joy.<br>

Blessed are you who believed<br>

that what was spoken to you by the Lord<br>

would be fulfilled.”</p>
