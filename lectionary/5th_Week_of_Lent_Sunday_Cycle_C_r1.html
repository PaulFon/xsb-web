  <p>A reading from the book of Isaih <br>

Thus says the LORD,<br>

who opens a way in the sea<br>

and a path in the mighty waters,<br>

who leads out chariots and horsemen,<br>

            a powerful army,<br>

till they lie prostrate together, never to rise,<br>

            snuffed out and quenched like a wick.<br>

Remember not the events of the past,<br>

            the things of long ago consider not;<br>

see, I am doing something new!<br>

            Now it springs forth, do you not perceive it?<br>

In the desert I make a way,<br>

            in the wasteland, rivers.<br>

Wild beasts honor me,<br>

            jackals and ostriches,<br>

for I put water in the desert<br>

            and rivers in the wasteland<br>

            for my chosen people to drink,<br>

the people whom I formed for myself,<br>

            that they might announce my praise.</p>
