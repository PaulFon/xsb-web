  <p>R. May God bless us in his mercy.<br>

May God have pity on us and bless us;<br>

may he let his face shine upon us.<br>

So may your way be known upon earth;<br>

among all nations, your salvation.<br>

R. May God bless us in his mercy.<br>

May the nations be glad and exult<br>

because you rule the peoples in equity;<br>

the nations on the earth you guide.<br>

R. May God bless us in his mercy.<br>

May the peoples praise you, O God;<br>

may all the peoples praise you!<br>

May God bless us,<br>

and may all the ends of the earth fear him!<br>

R. May God bless us in his mercy.</p>
