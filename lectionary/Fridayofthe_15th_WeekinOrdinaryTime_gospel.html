<div class="poetry">
<p>Jesus was going through a field of grain on the sabbath.<br />
His disciples were hungry<br />
and began to pick the heads of grain and eat them.<br />
When the Pharisees saw this, they said to him,<br />
“See, your disciples are doing what is unlawful to do on the sabbath.”<br />
He said to the them, “Have you not read what David did<br />
when he and his companions were hungry,<br />
how he went into the house of God and ate the bread of offering,<br />
which neither he nor his companions<br />
but only the priests could lawfully eat?<br />
Or have you not read in the law that on the sabbath<br />
the priests serving in the temple violate the sabbath<br />
and are innocent?<br />
I say to you, something greater than the temple is here.<br />
If you knew what this meant, <em>I desire mercy, not sacrifice,</em><br />
you would not have condemned these innocent men.<br />
For the Son of Man is Lord of the sabbath.”</p>
