<div class="poetry">
<p>Jesus proposed another parable to the crowds, saying:<br />
“The kingdom of heaven may be likened<br />
to a man who sowed good seed in his field.<br />
While everyone was asleep his enemy came<br />
and sowed weeds all through the wheat, and then went off.<br />
When the crop grew and bore fruit, the weeds appeared as well.<br />
The slaves of the householder came to him and said,<br />
‘Master, did you not sow good seed in your field?<br />
Where have the weeds come from?’<br />
He answered, ‘An enemy has done this.’<br />
His slaves said to him,<br />
‘Do you want us to go and pull them up?’<br />
He replied, ‘No, if you pull up the weeds<br />
you might uproot the wheat along with them.<br />
Let them grow together until harvest;<br />
then at harvest time I will say to the harvesters,<br />
“First collect the weeds and tie them in bundles for burning;<br />
but gather the wheat into my barn.”’”</p>
<p>He proposed another parable to them.<br />
“The kingdom of heaven is like a mustard seed<br />
that a person took and sowed in a field.<br />
It is the smallest of all the seeds,<br />
yet when full-grown it is the largest of plants.<br />
It becomes a large bush,<br />
and the ‘birds of the sky come and dwell in its branches.’”</p>
<p>He spoke to them another parable.<br />
“The kingdom of heaven is like yeast<br />
that a woman took and mixed with three measures of wheat flour<br />
until the whole batch was leavened.”</p>
<p>All these things Jesus spoke to the crowds in parables.<br />
He spoke to them only in parables,<br />
to fulfill what had been said through the prophet:<br />
<em>I will open my mouth in parables,<br />
I will announce what has lain hidden from the foundation<br />
of the world.</em></p>
<p>Then, dismissing the crowds, he went into the house.<br />
His disciples approached him and said,<br />
“Explain to us the parable of the weeds in the field.”<br />
He said in reply, “He who sows good seed is the Son of Man,<br />
the field is the world, the good seed the children of the kingdom.<br />
The weeds are the children of the evil one,<br />
and the enemy who sows them is the devil.<br />
The harvest is the end of the age, and the harvesters are angels.<br />
Just as weeds are collected and burned up with fire,<br />
so will it be at the end of the age.<br />
The Son of Man will send his angels,<br />
and they will collect out of his kingdom<br />
all who cause others to sin and all evildoers.<br />
They will throw them into the fiery furnace,<br />
where there will be wailing and grinding of teeth.<br />
Then the righteous will shine like the sun<br />
in the kingdom of their Father.<br />
Whoever has ears ought to hear.”</p>
