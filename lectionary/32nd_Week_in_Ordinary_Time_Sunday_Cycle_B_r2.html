  <p>A reading from the Letter of Saint Paul to the Hebrews: <br>

Christ did not enter into a sanctuary made by hands,<br>

a copy of the true one, but heaven itself,<br>

that he might now appear before God on our behalf. <br>

Not that he might offer himself repeatedly,<br>

as the high priest enters each year into the sanctuary<br>

with blood that is not his own;<br>

if that were so, he would have had to suffer repeatedly<br>

from the foundation of the world. <br>

But now once for all he has appeared at the end of the ages<br>

to take away sin by his sacrifice. <br>

Just as it is appointed that human beings die once,<br>

and after this the judgment, so also Christ,<br>

offered once to take away the sins of many,<br>

will appear a second time, not to take away sin<br>

but to bring salvation to those who eagerly await him.</p>
