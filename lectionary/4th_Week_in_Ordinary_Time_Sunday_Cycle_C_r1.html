  <p>A reading from the Book of Jeremiah: <br>

The word of the LORD came to me, saying:<br>

Before I formed you in the womb I knew you,<br>

before you were born I dedicated you,<br>

a prophet to the nations I appointed you.<br>

But do you gird your loins;<br>

stand up and tell them<br>

all that I command you.<br>

Be not crushed on their account,<br>

as though I would leave you crushed before them;<br>

for it is I this day<br>

who have made you a fortified city,<br>

a pillar of iron, a wall of brass,<br>

against the whole land:<br>

against Judah’s kings and princes,<br>

against its priests and people.<br>

They will fight against you but not prevail over you, <br>

for I am with you to deliver you, says the LORD.</p>
