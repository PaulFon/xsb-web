  <p>A reading from the holy Gospel according to John. R. Glory to you, O Lord. <br>

Since the Passover of the Jews was near,<br>

Jesus went up to Jerusalem.<br>

He found in the temple area those who sold oxen, sheep, and doves,<br>

as well as the money-changers seated there.<br>

He made a whip out of cords<br>

and drove them all out of the temple area, with the sheep and oxen,<br>

and spilled the coins of the money-changers<br>

and overturned their tables,<br>

and to those who sold doves he said,<br>

“Take these out of here,<br>

and stop making my Father’s house a marketplace.”<br>

His disciples recalled the words of Scripture,<br>

    Zeal for your house will consume me.<br>

At this the Jews answered and said to him,<br>

“What sign can you show us for doing this?”<br>

Jesus answered and said to them,<br>

“Destroy this temple and in three days I will raise it up.”<br>

The Jews said,<br>

“This temple has been under construction for forty-six years,<br>

and you will raise it up in three days?”<br>

But he was speaking about the temple of his Body.<br>

Therefore, when he was raised from the dead,<br>

his disciples remembered that he had said this,<br>

and they came to believe the Scripture<br>

and the word Jesus had spoken.</p>
