  <p>Almighty ever-living God,<br>

who as an example of humility for the human race to follow<br>

caused our Saviour to take flesh<br>

and submit to the Cross,<br>

graciously grant that we may heed his lesson<br>

of patient suffering<br>

and so merit a share in his Resurrection.<br>

<br>

Who lives and reigns with you in the unity of the Holy Spirit,<br>

one God, for ever and ever.</p>
