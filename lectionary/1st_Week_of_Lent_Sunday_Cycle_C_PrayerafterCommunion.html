  <p>Renewed now with heavenly bread,<br>

by which faith is nourished, hope increased,<br>

and charity strengthened, we pray, O Lord,<br>

that we may learn to hunger for Christ,<br>

the true and living Bread,<br>

and strive to live by every word<br>

which proceeds from your mouth.<br>

Through Christ our Lord.</p>
