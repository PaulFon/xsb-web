  <p>Of you my heart has spoken, Seek his face. <br>

It is your face, O Lord, that I seek; <br>

hide not your face from me.<br>

or <br>

Remember your compassion, O Lord, <br>

and your merciful love, for they are from of old. <br>

Let not our enemies exult over us. <br>

Redeem us, O God of Israel, from all our distress.</p>
