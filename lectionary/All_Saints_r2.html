  <p>A reading from the First Letter of John: Beloved:<br>

See what love the Father has bestowed on us<br>

that we may be called the children of God.<br>

Yet so we are.<br>

The reason the world does not know us<br>

is that it did not know him.<br>

Beloved, we are God’s children now;<br>

what we shall be has not yet been revealed.<br>

We do know that when it is revealed we shall be like him,<br>

for we shall see him as he is.<br>

Everyone who has this hope based on him makes himself pure,<br>

as he is pure.</p>
