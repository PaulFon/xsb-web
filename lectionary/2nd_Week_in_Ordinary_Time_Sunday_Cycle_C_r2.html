  <p>A reading from the First Letter of Saint Paul to the Corinthians: <br>

Brothers and sisters:<br>

There are different kinds of spiritual gifts but the same Spirit; <br>

there are different forms of service but the same Lord;<br>

there are different workings but the same God<br>

who produces all of them in everyone.<br>

To each individual the manifestation of the Spirit<br>

is given for some benefit.<br>

To one is given through the Spirit the expression of wisdom;<br>

to another, the expression of knowledge according to the<br>

same Spirit;<br>

to another, faith by the same Spirit;<br>

to another, gifts of healing by the one Spirit;<br>

to another, mighty deeds;<br>

to another, prophecy;<br>

to another, discernment of spirits;<br>

to another, varieties of tongues;<br>

to another, interpretation of tongues.<br>

But one and the same Spirit produces all of these,<br>

distributing them individually to each person as he wishes.</p>
