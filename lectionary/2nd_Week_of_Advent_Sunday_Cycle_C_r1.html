  <p>A reading from the Book of Baruch: Jerusalem, take off your robe of mourning and misery;<br>

    put on the splendor of glory from God forever:<br>

wrapped in the cloak of justice from God,<br>

    bear on your head the mitre<br>

    that displays the glory of the eternal name.<br>

For God will show all the earth your splendor:<br>

    you will be named by God forever<br>

    the peace of justice, the glory of God’s worship. <br>

Up, Jerusalem! stand upon the heights;<br>

    look to the east and see your children<br>

gathered from the east and the west<br>

    at the word of the Holy One,<br>

    rejoicing that they are remembered by God.<br>

Led away on foot by their enemies they left you:<br>

    but God will bring them back to you<br>

    borne aloft in glory as on royal thrones.<br>

For God has commanded<br>

    that every lofty mountain be made low,<br>

and that the age-old depths and gorges<br>

    be filled to level ground,<br>

    that Israel may advance secure in the glory of God.<br>

The forests and every fragrant kind of tree<br>

    have overshadowed Israel at God’s command;<br>

for God is leading Israel in joy<br>

    by the light of his glory,<br>

    with his mercy and justice for company.</p>
