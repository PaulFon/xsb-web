  <p>R (2a)  O Lord, our God, how wonderful your name in all the earth!<br>

When I behold your heavens, the work of your fingers,<br>

            the moon and the stars which you set in place —<br>

What is man that you should be mindful of him,<br>

            or the son of man that you should care for him?<br>

R O Lord, our God, how wonderful your name in all the earth!<br>

You have made him little less than the angels,<br>

            and crowned him with glory and honor.<br>

You have given him rule over the works of your hands,<br>

            putting all things under his feet:<br>

R O Lord, our God, how wonderful your name in all the earth!<br>

All sheep and oxen,<br>

            yes, and the beasts of the field,<br>

The birds of the air, the fishes of the sea,<br>

            and whatever swims the paths of the seas.<br>

R O Lord, our God, how wonderful your name in all the earth!</p>
