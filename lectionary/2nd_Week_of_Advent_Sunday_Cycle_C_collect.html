  <p>Collect—Almighty and merciful God, may no earthly undertaking hinder<br>

those who set out in haste to meet your Son, but may our learning of<br>

heavenly wisdom gain us admittance to his company. Who lives and<br>

reigns with you in the unity of the Holy Spirit, God, for ever and ever. R.<br>

Amen.</p>
