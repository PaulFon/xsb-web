  <p>A reading from the letter of Saint Paul to the Ephesians<br>

Brothers and sisters:<br>

Do not grieve the Holy Spirit of God,<br>

with which you were sealed for the day of redemption. <br>

All bitterness, fury, anger, shouting, and reviling<br>

must be removed from you, along with all malice. <br>

And be kind to one another, compassionate,<br>

forgiving one another as God has forgiven you in Christ.<br>

<br>

So be imitators of God, as beloved children, and live in love,<br>

as Christ loved us and handed himself over for us<br>

as a sacrificial offering to God for a fragrant aroma.</p>
