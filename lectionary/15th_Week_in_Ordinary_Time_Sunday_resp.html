<div class="poetry">
<p>R. (Lk 8:8) <strong>The seed that falls on good ground will yield a fruitful harvest.</strong><br />
You have visited the land and watered it;<br />
greatly have you enriched it.<br />
God’s watercourses are filled;<br />
you have prepared the grain.<br />
R. <strong>The seed that falls on good ground will yield a fruitful harvest.</strong><br />
Thus have you prepared the land: drenching its furrows,<br />
breaking up its clods,<br />
Softening it with showers,<br />
blessing its yield.<br />
R. <strong>The seed that falls on good ground will yield a fruitful harvest.</strong><br />
You have crowned the year with your bounty,<br />
and your paths overflow with a rich harvest;<br />
The untilled meadows overflow with it,<br />
and rejoicing clothes the hills.<br />
R. <strong>The seed that falls on good ground will yield a fruitful harvest.</strong><br />
The fields are garmented with flocks<br />
and the valleys blanketed with grain.<br />
They shout and sing for joy.<br />
R. <strong>The seed that falls on good ground will yield a fruitful harvest.</strong></p>
