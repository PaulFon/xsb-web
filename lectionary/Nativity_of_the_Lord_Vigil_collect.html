  <p>O God, who gladden us year by year as we wait in hope for<br>

our redemption, grant that, just as we joyfully welcome your Only<br>

Begotten Son as our Redeemer, we may also merit to face him<br>

confidently when he comes again as our Judge. Who lives and reigns<br>

with you in the unity of the Holy Spirit, God, for ever and ever. R. Amen.</p>
