  <p>At that time, Jesus revealed himself again <br>

to his disciples at the Sea of Tiberias.<br>

He revealed himself in this way.<br>

Together were Simon Peter, Thomas called Didymus,<br>

Nathanael from Cana in Galilee,<br>

Zebedee’s sons, and two others of his disciples.<br>

Simon Peter said to them, “I am going fishing.”<br>

They said to him, “We also will come with you.”<br>

So they went out and got into the boat,<br>

but that night they caught nothing.<br>

When it was already dawn, Jesus was standing on the shore;<br>

but the disciples did not realize that it was Jesus.<br>

Jesus said to them, “Children, have you caught anything to eat?”<br>

They answered him, “No.”<br>

So he said to them, “Cast the net over the right side of the boat<br>

and you will find something.”<br>

So they cast it, and were not able to pull it in<br>

because of the number of fish.<br>

So the disciple whom Jesus loved said to Peter, “It is the Lord.”<br>

When Simon Peter heard that it was the Lord,<br>

he tucked in his garment, for he was lightly clad,<br>

and jumped into the sea.<br>

The other disciples came in the boat,<br>

for they were not far from shore, only about a hundred yards,<br>

dragging the net with the fish.<br>

When they climbed out on shore,<br>

they saw a charcoal fire with fish on it and bread.<br>

Jesus said to them, “Bring some of the fish you just caught.”<br>

So Simon Peter went over and dragged the net ashore<br>

full of one hundred fifty-three large fish.<br>

Even though there were so many, the net was not torn.<br>

Jesus said to them, “Come, have breakfast.”<br>

And none of the disciples dared to ask him, “Who are you?”<br>

because they realized it was the Lord.<br>

Jesus came over and took the bread and gave it to them,<br>

and in like manner the fish.<br>

This was now the third time Jesus was revealed to his disciples<br>

after being raised from the dead.<br>

<br>

When they had finished breakfast, Jesus said to Simon Peter,<br>

“Simon, son of John, do you love me more than these?”<br>

Simon Peter answered him, “Yes, Lord, you know that I love you.”<br>

Jesus said to him, “Feed my lambs.”<br>

He then said to Simon Peter a second time,<br>

“Simon, son of John, do you love me?”<br>

Simon Peter answered him, “Yes, Lord, you know that I love you.”<br>

Jesus said to him, “Tend my sheep.”<br>

Jesus said to him the third time,<br>

“Simon, son of John, do you love me?”<br>

Peter was distressed that Jesus had said to him a third time,<br>

“Do you love me?” and he said to him,<br>

“Lord, you know everything; you know that I love you.”<br>

Jesus said to him, “Feed my sheep.<br>

Amen, amen, I say to you, when you were younger,<br>

you used to dress yourself and go where you wanted;<br>

but when you grow old, you will stretch out your hands,<br>

and someone else will dress you<br>

and lead you where you do not want to go.”<br>

He said this signifying by what <br>

kind of death he would glorify God.<br>

And when he had said this, he said to him, “Follow me.”<br>

<br>
