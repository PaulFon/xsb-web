  <p>I, John, your brother, who share with you<br>

the distress, the kingdom, and the endurance we have in Jesus,<br>

found myself on the island called Patmos<br>

because I proclaimed God’s word and gave testimony to Jesus.<br>

I was caught up in spirit on the Lord’s day<br>

and heard behind me a voice as loud as a trumpet, which said,<br>

“Write on a scroll what you see.”<br>

Then I turned to see whose voice it was that spoke to me,<br>

and when I turned, I saw seven gold lampstands<br>

and in the midst of the lampstands one like a son of man,<br>

wearing an ankle-length robe, with a gold sash around his chest.<br>

<br>

When I caught sight of him, I fell down at his feet as though dead.<br>

He touched me with his right hand and said, “Do not be afraid.<br>

I am the first and the last, the one who lives.<br>

Once I was dead, but now I am alive forever and ever.<br>

I hold the keys to death and the netherworld.<br>

Write down, therefore, what you have seen,<br>

and what is happening, and what will happen afterwards.”</p>
