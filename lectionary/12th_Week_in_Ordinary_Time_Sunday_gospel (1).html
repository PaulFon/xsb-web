<h4>Gospel <a href="/bible/matthew/10:26">Mt 10:26-33</a></h4>
<div class="poetry">
<p>Jesus said to the Twelve:<br />
“Fear no one.<br />
Nothing is concealed that will not be revealed,<br />
nor secret that will not be known.<br />
What I say to you in the darkness, speak in the light;<br />
what you hear whispered, proclaim on the housetops.<br />
And do not be afraid of those who kill the body but cannot kill the soul;<br />
rather, be afraid of the one who can destroy<br />
both soul and body in Gehenna.<br />
Are not two sparrows sold for a small coin?<br />
Yet not one of them falls to the ground without your Father’s knowledge.<br />
Even all the hairs of your head are counted.<br />
So do not be afraid; you are worth more than many sparrows.<br />
Everyone who acknowledges me before others<br />
I will acknowledge before my heavenly Father.<br />
But whoever denies me before others,<br />
I will deny before my heavenly Father.”</p>
