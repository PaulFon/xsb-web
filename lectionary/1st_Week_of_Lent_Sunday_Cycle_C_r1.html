  <p>Moses spoke to the people, saying:<br>

“The priest shall receive the basket from you<br>

and shall set it in front of the altar of the LORD, your God.<br>

Then you shall declare before the Lord, your God,<br>

‘My father was a wandering Aramean<br>

who went down to Egypt with a small household<br>

and lived there as an alien.<br>

But there he became a nation<br>

great, strong, and numerous.<br>

When the Egyptians maltreated and oppressed us,<br>

imposing hard labor upon us,<br>

we cried to the LORD, the God of our fathers,<br>

and he heard our cry<br>

and saw our affliction, our toil, and our oppression.<br>

He brought us out of Egypt<br>

with his strong hand and outstretched arm,<br>

with terrifying power, with signs and wonders;<br>

and bringing us into this country,<br>

he gave us this land flowing with milk and honey.<br>

Therefore, I have now brought you the firstfruits<br>

of the products of the soil<br>

which you, O LORD, have given me.’<br>

And having set them before the LORD, your God,<br>

you shall bow down in his presence.”</p>
