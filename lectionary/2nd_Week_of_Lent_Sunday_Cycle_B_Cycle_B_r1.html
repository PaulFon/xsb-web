  <p>God put Abraham to the test. <br>

He called to him, “Abraham!” <br>

“Here I am!” he replied. Then God said: <br>

“Take your son Isaac, your only one, whom you love, <br>

and go to the land of Moriah. <br>

There you shall offer him up<br>

as a holocaust on a height <br>

that I will point out to you.”<br>

When they came to the place <br>

of which God had told him, <br>

Abraham built an altar there <br>

and arranged the wood on it. <br>

Then he reached out and took the knife <br>

to slaughter his son. <br>

But the LORD’s messenger<br>

called to him from heaven, <br>

“Abraham, Abraham!” “Here I am!” he answered. <br>

“Do not lay your hand on the.boy,” <br>

said the messenger. <br>

“Do not do the least thing to him. <br>

I know now how devoted you are to God,<br>

since you did not withhold from me <br>

your own beloved son.” <br>

As Abraham looked about, he spied a ram<br>

caught by its horns in the thicket. <br>

So he went and took the ram and <br>

offered it up as a holocaust in place of his son.<br>

Again the LORD’s messenger called <br>

to Abraham from heaven and said: <br>

“I swear by myself, declares the LORD, <br>

that because you acted as you did <br>

in not withholding from me your beloved son, <br>

I will bless you abundantly <br>

and make your descendants as countless <br>

as the stars of the sky and the sands of the seashore;<br>

your descendants shall take possession <br>

of the gates of their enemies, <br>

and in your descendants all the<br>

nations of the earth shall find <br>

blessing—all this because you obeyed my command.”</p>
