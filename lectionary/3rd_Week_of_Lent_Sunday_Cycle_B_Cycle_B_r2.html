  <p>A reading from the first Letter <br>
of Saint Paul to the Corinthians: <br>
Brothers and sisters: <br>
Jews demand signs and Greeks look for wisdom, <br>
but we proclaim Christ crucified, <br>
a stumbling block to Jews <br>
and foolishness to Gentiles, <br>
but to those who are called, <br>
Jews and Greeks alike, <br>
Christ the power of God and the wisdom of God. <br>
For the foolishness of God <br>
is wiser than human wisdom, <br>
and the weakness of God <br>
is stronger than human strength.<br>
The word of the Lord. <br>
R. Thanks be to God.</p>
