  <p>A reading from the book of Deuteronomy: Moses said to the people:<br>

“Now, Israel, hear the statutes and decrees<br>

which I am teaching you to observe,<br>

that you may live, and may enter in and take possession of the land<br>

which the LORD, the God of your fathers, is giving you. <br>

In your observance of the commandments of the LORD, your God,<br>

which I enjoin upon you,<br>

you shall not add to what I command you nor subtract from it. <br>

Observe them carefully,<br>

for thus will you give evidence<br>

of your wisdom and intelligence to the nations,<br>

who will hear of all these statutes and say,<br>

‘This great nation is truly a wise and intelligent people.’<br>

For what great nation is there<br>

that has gods so close to it as the LORD, our God, is to us<br>

whenever we call upon him? <br>

Or what great nation has statutes and decrees<br>

that are as just as this whole law<br>

which I am setting before you today?”</p>
