  <p>R. Lord, every nation on earth will adore you.<br>

O God, with your judgment endow the king,<br>

and with your justice, the king’s son;<br>

He shall govern your people with justice<br>

and your afflicted ones with judgment.<br>

R. Lord, every nation on earth will adore you.<br>

Justice shall flower in his days,<br>

and profound peace, till the moon be no more.<br>

May he rule from sea to sea,<br>

and from the River to the ends of the earth.<br>

R. Lord, every nation on earth will adore you.<br>

The kings of Tarshish and the Isles shall offer gifts;<br>

the kings of Arabia and Seba shall bring tribute.<br>

All kings shall pay him homage,<br>

all nations shall serve him.<br>

R. Lord, every nation on earth will adore you.<br>

For he shall rescue the poor when he cries out,<br>

and the afflicted when he has no one to help him.<br>

He shall have pity for the lowly and the poor;<br>

the lives of the poor he shall save.<br>

R. Lord, every nation on earth will adore you.</p>
