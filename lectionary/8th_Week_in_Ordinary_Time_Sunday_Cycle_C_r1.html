  <p>A reading from the book of Sirach: <br>

When a sieve is shaken, the husks appear;<br>

so do one’s faults when one speaks.<br>

As the test of what the potter molds is in the furnace,<br>

so in tribulation is the test of the just.<br>

The fruit of a tree shows the care it has had;<br>

so too does one’s speech disclose the bent of one’s mind.<br>

Praise no one before he speaks,<br>

for it is then that people are tested.</p>
