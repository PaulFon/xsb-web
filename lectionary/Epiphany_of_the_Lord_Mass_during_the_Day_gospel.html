  <p>A reading from the holy Gospel according to Matthew. R. Glory to you, O Lord. <br>

When Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judea,<br>

in the days of King Herod, <br>

behold, magi from the east arrived in Jerusalem, saying, <br>

“Where is the newborn king of the Jews?<br>

We saw his star at its rising<br>

and have come to do him homage.”<br>

When King Herod heard this,<br>

he was greatly troubled, <br>

and all Jerusalem with him.<br>

Assembling all the chief priests and the scribes of the people, <br>

He inquired of them where the Christ was to be born.<br>

They said to him, “In Bethlehem of Judea, <br>

for thus it has been written through the prophet:<br>

And you, Bethlehem, land of Judah,<br>

are by no means least among the rulers of Judah;<br>

since from you shall come a ruler,<br>

who is to shepherd my people Israel.”<br>

Then Herod called the magi secretly <br>

and ascertained from them the time of the star’s appearance.<br>

He sent them to Bethlehem and said, <br>

“Go and search diligently for the child.<br>

When you have found him, bring me word, <br>

that I too may go and do him homage.”<br>

After their audience with the king they set out.<br>

And behold, the star that they had seen at its rising preceded them, <br>

until it came and stopped over the place where the child was.<br>

They were overjoyed at seeing the star, <br>

and on entering the house<br>

they saw the child with Mary his mother.<br>

They prostrated themselves and did him homage.<br>

Then they opened their treasures <br>

and offered him gifts of gold, frankincense, and myrrh.<br>

And having been warned in a dream not to return to Herod, <br>

they departed for their country by another way.</p>
