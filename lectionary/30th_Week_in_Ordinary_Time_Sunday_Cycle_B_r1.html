  <p>A reading from the Book of the Prophet Jeremiah: <br>

Thus says the LORD:<br>

    Shout with joy for Jacob,<br>

        exult at the head of the nations;<br>

        proclaim your praise and say:<br>

    The LORD has delivered his people,<br>

        the remnant of Israel.<br>

    Behold, I will bring them back<br>

        from the land of the north;<br>

    I will gather them from the ends of the world,<br>

        with the blind and the lame in their midst,<br>

    the mothers and those with child;<br>

        they shall return as an immense throng.<br>

    They departed in tears,<br>

        but I will console them and guide them;<br>

    I will lead them to brooks of water,<br>

        on a level road, so that none shall stumble.<br>

    For I am a father to Israel,<br>

        Ephraim is my first-born.</p>
