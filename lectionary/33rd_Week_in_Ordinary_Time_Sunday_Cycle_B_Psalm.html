  <p>R. (1) You are my inheritance, O Lord!<br>

O LORD, my allotted portion and my cup,<br>

    you it is who hold fast my lot.<br>

I set the LORD ever before me;<br>

    with him at my right hand I shall not be disturbed.<br>

R. You are my inheritance, O Lord!<br>

Therefore my heart is glad and my soul rejoices,<br>

    my body, too, abides in confidence;<br>

because you will not abandon my soul to the netherworld,<br>

    nor will you suffer your faithful one to undergo corruption.<br>

R. You are my inheritance, O Lord!<br>

You will show me the path to life,<br>

    fullness of joys in your presence,<br>

    the delights at your right hand forever.<br>

R. You are my inheritance, O Lord!</p>
