  <p>As we receive the pledge<br>

of things yet hidden in heaven<br>

and are nourished while still on earth<br>

with the Bread that comes from on high,<br>

we humbly entreat you, O Lord,<br>

that what is being brought about in us in mystery<br>

may come to true completion.<br>

Through Christ our Lord.</p>
