  <p>A reading from the letter of Saint James: Dearest brothers and sisters:<br>

All good giving and every perfect gift is from above,<br>

coming down from the Father of lights,<br>

with whom there is no alteration or shadow caused by change. <br>

He willed to give us birth by the word of truth<br>

that we may be a kind of firstfruits of his creatures.<br>

<br>

Humbly welcome the word that has been planted in you<br>

and is able to save your souls.<br>

<br>

Be doers of the word and not hearers only, deluding yourselves.<br>

<br>

Religion that is pure and undefiled before God and the Father is this:<br>

to care for orphans and widows in their affliction<br>

and to keep oneself unstained by the world.</p>
