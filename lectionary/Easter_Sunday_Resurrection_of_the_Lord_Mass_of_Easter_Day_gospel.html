  <p>On the first day of the week,<br>
Mary of Magdala came to the tomb early in the morning,<br>
while it was still dark, <br>
and saw the stone removed from the tomb.<br>
So she ran and went to Simon Peter <br>
and to the other disciple whom Jesus loved, and told them, <br>
“They have taken the Lord from the tomb, <br>
and we don’t know where they put him.”<br>
So Peter and the other disciple went out and came to the tomb.<br>
They both ran, but the other disciple ran faster than Peter <br>
and arrived at the tomb first; <br>
he bent down and saw the burial cloths there, but did not go in.<br>
When Simon Peter arrived after him, <br>
he went into the tomb and saw the burial cloths there, <br>
and the cloth that had covered his head, <br>
not with the burial cloths but rolled up in a separate place.<br>
Then the other disciple also went in, <br>
the one who had arrived at the tomb first, <br>
and he saw and believed.<br>
For they did not yet understand the Scripture <br>
that he had to rise from the dead.</p>
