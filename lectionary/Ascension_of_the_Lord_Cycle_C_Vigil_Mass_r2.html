  <p>Brothers and sisters:<br>

May the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory,<br>

give you a Spirit of wisdom and revelation<br>

resulting in knowledge of him.<br>

May the eyes of your hearts be enlightened,<br>

that you may know what is the hope that belongs to his call,<br>

what are the riches of glory<br>

in his inheritance among the holy ones,<br>

and what is the surpassing greatness of his power<br>

for us who believe,<br>

in accord with the exercise of his great might:<br>

which he worked in Christ,<br>

raising him from the dead<br>

and seating him at his right hand in the heavens,<br>

far above every principality, authority, power, and dominion,<br>

and every name that is named<br>

not only in this age but also in the one to come.<br>

And he put all things beneath his feet<br>

and gave him as head over all things to the church,<br>

which is his body,<br>

the fullness of the one who fills all things in every way.<br>

<br>

OR:<br>

<br>

Heb 9:24-28; 10:19-23<br>

<br>

Christ did not enter into a sanctuary made by hands,<br>

a copy of the true one, but heaven itself,<br>

that he might now appear before God on our behalf.<br>

Not that he might offer himself repeatedly,<br>

as the high priest enters each year into the sanctuary<br>

with blood that is not his own;<br>

if that were so, he would have had to suffer repeatedly<br>

from the foundation of the world.<br>

But now once for all he has appeared at the end of the ages<br>

to take away sin by his sacrifice.<br>

Just as it is appointed that men and women die once,<br>

and after this the judgment, so also Christ,<br>

offered once to take away the sins of many,<br>

will appear a second time, not to take away sin<br>

but to bring salvation to those who eagerly await him.<br>

<br>

Therefore, brothers and sisters, since through the blood of Jesus<br>

we have confidence of entrance into the sanctuary<br>

by the new and living way he opened for us through the veil,<br>

that is, his flesh,<br>

and since we have "a great priest over the house of God,"<br>

let us approach with a sincere heart and in absolute trust,<br>

with our hearts sprinkled clean from an evil conscience<br>

and our bodies washed in pure water.<br>

Let us hold unwaveringly to our confession that gives us hope,<br>

for he who made the promise is trustworthy.</p>
