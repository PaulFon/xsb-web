  <p>A reading from the book of Revelation<br>

I, John, looked and heard the voices of many angels<br>

who surrounded the throne<br>

and the living creatures and the elders.<br>

They were countless in number, and they cried out in a loud voice:<br>

“Worthy is the Lamb that was slain<br>

to receive power and riches, wisdom and strength,<br>

honor and glory and blessing.”<br>

Then I heard every creature in heaven and on earth<br>

and under the earth and in the sea,<br>

everything in the universe, cry out:<br>

“To the one who sits on the throne and to the Lamb<br>

be blessing and honor, glory and might,<br>

forever and ever.”<br>

The four living creatures answered, “Amen, “<br>

and the elders fell down and worshiped.</p>
