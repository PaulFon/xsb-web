  <p>A reading from the First Book of Kings: In those days, Elijah the prophet went to Zarephath.<br>

As he arrived at the entrance of the city,<br>

a widow was gathering sticks there; he called out to her,<br>

"Please bring me a small cupful of water to drink." <br>

She left to get it, and he called out after her,<br>

"Please bring along a bit of bread." <br>

She answered, "As the LORD, your God, lives,<br>

I have nothing baked; there is only a handful of flour in my jar<br>

and a little oil in my jug. <br>

Just now I was collecting a couple of sticks,<br>

to go in and prepare something for myself and my son;<br>

when we have eaten it, we shall die." <br>

Elijah said to her, "Do not be afraid. <br>

Go and do as you propose.<br>

But first make me a little cake and bring it to me. <br>

Then you can prepare something for yourself and your son. <br>

For the LORD, the God of Israel, says,<br>

'The jar of flour shall not go empty,<br>

nor the jug of oil run dry,<br>

until the day when the LORD sends rain upon the earth.'" <br>

She left and did as Elijah had said. <br>

She was able to eat for a year, and he and her son as well;<br>

the jar of flour did not go empty,<br>

nor the jug of oil run dry,<br>

as the LORD had foretold through Elijah.</p>
