  <p>Let us pray.<br>

Almighty ever-living God,<br>

constantly accomplish the Paschal Mystery within us,<br>

that those you were pleased to make new in Holy Baptism <br>

may, under your protective care, bear much fruit<br>

and come to the joys of life eternal.<br>

<br>

Through our Lord Jesus Christ, your Son,<br>

who lives and reigns with you in the unity of the Holy Spirit,<br>

one God, for ever and ever.</p>
