  <p>A reading from the First Letter of Saint Paul to the Thessalonians: <br>

Brothers and sisters:<br>

May the Lord make you increase and abound in love<br>

for one another and for all,<br>

just as we have for you, <br>

so as to strengthen your hearts, <br>

to be blameless in holiness before our God and Father <br>

at the coming of our Lord Jesus with all his holy ones.  Amen.<br>

<br>

Finally, brothers and sisters, <br>

we earnestly ask and exhort you in the Lord Jesus that,<br>

as you received from us <br>

how you should conduct yourselves to please God<br>

and as you are conducting yourselves<br>

you do so even more.<br>

For you know what instructions we gave you through the Lord Jesus.</p>
