  <p>A reading from the holy Gospel according to Luke. R. Glory to you, O Lord. <br>

Since many have undertaken to compile a narrative of the events<br>

that have been fulfilled among us,<br>

just as those who were eyewitnesses from the beginning<br>

and ministers of the word have handed them down to us,<br>

I too have decided,<br>

after investigating everything accurately anew,<br>

to write it down in an orderly sequence for you,<br>

most excellent Theophilus, <br>

so that you may realize the certainty of the teachings<br>

you have received.<br>

<br>

Jesus returned to Galilee in the power of the Spirit,<br>

and news of him spread throughout the whole region.<br>

He taught in their synagogues and was praised by all.<br>

<br>

He came to Nazareth, where he had grown up,<br>

and went according to his custom <br>

into the synagogue on the sabbath day.<br>

He stood up to read and was handed a scroll of the prophet Isaiah.<br>

He unrolled the scroll and found the passage where it was written:<br>

            The Spirit of the Lord is upon me,<br>

                        because he has anointed me <br>

                        to bring glad tidings to the poor.<br>

            He has sent me to proclaim liberty to captives<br>

                        and recovery of sight to the blind,<br>

                        to let the oppressed go free,<br>

                        and to proclaim a year acceptable to the Lord.<br>

Rolling up the scroll, he handed it back to the attendant and sat down,<br>

and the eyes of all in the synagogue looked intently at him.<br>

He said to them,<br>

“Today this Scripture passage is fulfilled in your hearing.”</p>
