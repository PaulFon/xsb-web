  <p>A Reading from the book of Isaiah <br>

The Lord GOD has given me<br>

a well-trained tongue,<br>

that I might know how to speak to the weary<br>

a word that will rouse them.<br>

Morning after morning<br>

he opens my ear that I may hear;<br>

and I have not rebelled,<br>

have not turned back.<br>

I gave my back to those who beat me,<br>

my cheeks to those who plucked my beard;<br>

my face I did not shield<br>

from buffets and spitting.<br>

The Lord GOD is my help,<br>

therefore I am not disgraced;<br>

I have set my face like flint,<br>

knowing that I shall not be put to shame.</p>
