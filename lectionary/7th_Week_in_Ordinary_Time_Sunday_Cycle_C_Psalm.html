  <p>R. The Lord is kind and merciful.<br>

Bless the LORD, O my soul;<br>

and all my being, bless his holy name.<br>

Bless the LORD, O my soul,<br>

and forget not all his benefits.<br>

R. The Lord is kind and merciful.<br>

He pardons all your iniquities,<br>

heals all your ills.<br>

He redeems your life from destruction,<br>

crowns you with kindness and compassion.<br>

R. The Lord is kind and merciful.<br>

Merciful and gracious is the LORD,<br>

slow to anger and abounding in kindness.<br>

Not according to our sins does he deal with us,<br>

nor does he requite us according to our crimes.<br>

R. The Lord is kind and merciful.<br>

As far as the east is from the west,<br>

so far has he put our transgressions from us.<br>

As a father has compassion on his children,<br>

so the LORD has compassion on those who fear him.<br>

R The Lord is kind and merciful.</p>
