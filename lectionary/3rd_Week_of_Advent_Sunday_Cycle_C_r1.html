  <p>A reading from the Book of the Prophet Zephaniah:<br>

Shout for joy, O daughter Zion!<br>

        Sing joyfully, O Israel!<br>

    Be glad and exult with all your heart,<br>

        O daughter Jerusalem!<br>

    The LORD has removed the judgment against you<br>

        he has turned away your enemies;<br>

    the King of Israel, the LORD, is in your midst,<br>

        you have no further misfortune to fear.<br>

    On that day, it shall be said to Jerusalem:<br>

        Fear not, O Zion, be not discouraged!<br>

    The LORD, your God, is in your midst,<br>

        a mighty savior;<br>

    he will rejoice over you with gladness,<br>

        and renew you in his love,<br>

    he will sing joyfully because of you,<br>

        as one sings at festivals.</p>
