  <p>O God, who teach us that you abide <br>

in hearts that are just and true, <br>

grant that we may be so fashioned by your grace <br>

as to become a dwelling pleasing to you. <br>

Through our Lord Jesus Christ, your Son, <br>

who lives and reigns with you in the unity of the Holy Spirit, <br>

God, for ever and ever. R. Amen.<br>
