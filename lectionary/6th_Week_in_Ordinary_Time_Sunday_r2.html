  <p>A reading from the first Letter of Saint Paul to the Corinthians: Brothers and sisters, whether you eat or drink, or whatever you do, do everything for the glory of God. Avoid giving offense, whether to the Jews or Greeks or the church of God, just as I try to please everyone in every way, not seeking my own benefit but that of the many, that they may be saved. Be imitators of me, as I am of Christ.—The word of the Lord. R. Thanks be to God.</p>
