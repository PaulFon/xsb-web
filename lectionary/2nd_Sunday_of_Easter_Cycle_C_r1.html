  <p>Many signs and wonders were done among the people<br>

at the hands of the apostles.<br>

They were all together in Solomon’s portico.<br>

None of the others dared to join them, but the people esteemed them.<br>

Yet more than ever, believers in the Lord,<br>

great numbers of men and women, were added to them.<br>

Thus they even carried the sick out into the streets<br>

and laid them on cots and mats<br>

so that when Peter came by,<br>

at least his shadow might fall on one or another of them.<br>

A large number of people from the towns<br>

in the vicinity of Jerusalem also gathered,<br>

bringing the sick and those disturbed by unclean spirits,<br>

and they were all cured.</p>
