<div class="poetry">
<p>Moses said to the people:<br />
&quot;Remember how for forty years now the LORD, your God,<br />
has directed all your journeying in the desert,<br />
so as to test you by affliction<br />
and find out whether or not it was your intention<br />
to keep his commandments.<br />
He therefore let you be afflicted with hunger,<br />
and then fed you with manna,<br />
a food unknown to you and your fathers,<br />
in order to show you that not by bread alone does one live,<br />
but by every word that comes forth from the mouth of the LORD.</p>
<p>&quot;Do not forget the LORD, your God,<br />
who brought you out of the land of Egypt,<br />
that place of slavery;<br />
who guided you through the vast and terrible desert<br />
with its saraph serpents and scorpions,<br />
its parched and waterless ground;<br />
who brought forth water for you from the flinty rock<br />
and fed you in the desert with manna,<br />
a food unknown to your fathers.&quot;</p>
