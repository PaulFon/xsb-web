<div class="poetry">
<p>R. (23b) <strong>To the upright I will show the saving power of God.</strong><br />
“Not for your sacrifices do I rebuke you,<br />
for your burnt offerings are before me always.<br />
I take from your house no bullock,<br />
no goats out of your fold.”<br />
R. <strong>To the upright I will show the saving power of God.</strong></p>
<p>“Why do you recite my statutes,<br />
and profess my covenant with your mouth,<br />
Though you hate discipline<br />
and cast my words behind you?”<br />
R.<strong> To the upright I will show the saving power of God.</strong><br />
“When you do these things, shall I be deaf to it?<br />
Or do you think you that I am like yourself?<br />
I will correct you by drawing them up before your eyes.<br />
He that offers praise as a sacrifice glorifies me;<br />
and to him that goes the right way I will show the salvation of God.”<br />
R. <strong>To the upright I will show the saving power of God.</strong></p>
