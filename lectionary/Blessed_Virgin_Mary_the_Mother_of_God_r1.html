  <p>A reading from the Book of Numbers: <br>

The LORD said to Moses:  <br>

“Speak to Aaron and his sons and tell them:  <br>

This is how you shall bless the Israelites.<br>

Say to them:  <br>

The LORD bless you and keep you!  <br>

The LORD let his face shine upon      <br>

you, and be gracious to you!  <br>

The LORD look upon you kindly and      <br>

give you peace!<br>

So shall they invoke my name upon the Israelites,  <br>

and I will bless them.”</p>
