<div class="poetry">
<p>Woe to those who plan iniquity,<br />
and work out evil on their couches;<br />
In the morning light they accomplish it<br />
when it lies within their power.<br />
They covet fields, and seize them;<br />
houses, and they take them;<br />
They cheat an owner of his house,<br />
a man of his inheritance.<br />
Therefore thus says the LORD:<br />
Behold, I am planning against this race an evil<br />
from which you shall not withdraw your necks;<br />
Nor shall you walk with head high,<br />
for it will be a time of evil.</p>
<p>On that day a satire shall be sung over you,<br />
and there shall be a plaintive chant:<br />
“Our ruin is complete,<br />
our fields are portioned out among our captors,<br />
The fields of my people are measured out,<br />
and no one can get them back!”<br />
Thus you shall have no one<br />
to mark out boundaries by lot<br />
in the assembly of the LORD.</p>
