  <p>A reading from the book of Revelation: <br>

God’s temple in heaven was opened,<br>

and the ark of his covenant could be seen in the temple.<br>

<br>

A great sign appeared in the sky, a woman clothed with the sun,<br>

with the moon under her feet,<br>

and on her head a crown of twelve stars.<br>

She was with child and wailed aloud in pain as she labored to give birth.<br>

Then another sign appeared in the sky;<br>

it was a huge red dragon, with seven heads and ten horns,<br>

and on its heads were seven diadems.<br>

Its tail swept away a third of the stars in the sky<br>

and hurled them down to the earth.<br>

Then the dragon stood before the woman about to give birth,<br>

to devour her child when she gave birth.<br>

She gave birth to a son, a male child,<br>

destined to rule all the nations with an iron rod.<br>

Her child was caught up to God and his throne.<br>

The woman herself fled into the desert<br>

where she had a place prepared by God.<br>

<br>

Then I heard a loud voice in heaven say:<br>

 “Now have salvation and power come,<br>

 and the Kingdom of our God<br>

 and the authority of his Anointed One.”</p>
