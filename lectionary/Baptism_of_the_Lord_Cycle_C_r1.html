  <p>A reading from the Book of the Prophet Isaiah: <br>

Thus says the LORD:<br>

Here is my servant whom I uphold,<br>

     my chosen one with whom I am pleased,<br>

upon whom I have put my spirit;<br>

     he shall bring forth justice to the nations,<br>

not crying out, not shouting,<br>

     not making his voice heard in the street.<br>

a bruised reed he shall not break,<br>

     and a smoldering wick he shall not quench,<br>

until he establishes justice on the earth;<br>

     the coastlands will wait for his teaching.<br>

<br>

I, the LORD, have called you for the victory of justice,<br>

     I have grasped you by the hand;<br>

I formed you, and set you<br>

     as a covenant of the people,<br>

     a light for the nations,<br>

to open the eyes of the blind,<br>

     to bring out prisoners from confinement,<br>

     and from the dungeon, those who live in darkness.<br>

<br>

OR:<br>

<br>

Is  40:1-5, 9-11<br>

<br>

Comfort, give comfort to my people,<br>

            says your God.<br>

Speak tenderly to Jerusalem, and proclaim to her<br>

            that her service is at an end,<br>

            her guilt is expiated;<br>

indeed, she has received from the hand of the LORD<br>

            double for all her sins.<br>

<br>

            A voice cries out:<br>

In the desert prepare the way of the LORD!<br>

            Make straight in the wasteland a highway for our God!<br>

Every valley shall be filled in,<br>

            every mountain and hill shall be made low;<br>

the rugged land shall be made a plain,<br>

            the rough country, a broad valley. <br>

Then the glory of the LORD shall be revealed,<br>

            and all people shall see it together;<br>

            for the mouth of the LORD has spoken.<br>

<br>

Go up on to a high mountain,<br>

            Zion, herald of glad tidings;<br>

cry out at the top of your voice,<br>

            Jerusalem, herald of good news!<br>

Fear not to cry out<br>

            and say to the cities of Judah:<br>

            Here is your God!<br>

Here comes with power<br>

            the Lord GOD,<br>

            who rules by a strong arm;<br>

here is his reward with him,<br>

            his recompense before him.<br>

Like a shepherd he feeds his flock;<br>

            in his arms he gathers the lambs,<br>

carrying them in his bosom,<br>

            and leading the ewes with care.</p>
