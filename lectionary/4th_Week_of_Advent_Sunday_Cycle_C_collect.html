  <p>Pour forth, we beseech you, O Lord, your grace into our<br>

hearts, that we, to whom the Incarnation of Christ your Son was made<br>

known by the message of an Angel, may by his Passion and Cross be<br>

brought to the glory of his Resurrection. Who lives and reigns with you<br>

in the unity of the Holy Spirit, God, for ever and ever. R. Amen.</p>
