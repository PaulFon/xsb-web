  <p>A reading from the Book of the Prophet Ezekiel: <br>

The angel brought me<br>

back to the entrance of the temple,<br>

and I saw water flowing out<br>

from beneath the threshold of the temple toward the east,<br>

for the façade of the temple was toward the east;<br>

the water flowed down from the southern side of the temple,<br>

south of the altar.<br>

He led me outside by the north gate,<br>

and around to the outer gate facing the east,<br>

where I saw water trickling from the southern side.<br>

He said to me,<br>

“This water flows into the eastern district down upon the Arabah,<br>

and empties into the sea, the salt waters, which it makes fresh.<br>

Wherever the river flows,<br>

every sort of living creature that can multiply shall live,<br>

and there shall be abundant fish,<br>

for wherever this water comes the sea shall be made fresh.<br>

Along both banks of the river, fruit trees of every kind shall grow;<br>

their leaves shall not fade, nor their fruit fail.<br>

Every month they shall bear fresh fruit,<br>

for they shall be watered by the flow from the sanctuary.<br>

Their fruit shall serve for food, and their leaves for medicine.”</p>
