  <p>May God, who by the Resurrection of his Only Begotten Son<br>

was pleased to confer on you<br>

the gift of redemption and of adoption,<br>

give you gladness by his blessing.<br>

<br>

Amen.<br>

<br>

May he, by whose redeeming work you have received<br>

the gift of everlasting freedom,<br>

make you heirs to an eternal inheritance.<br>

<br>

Amen.<br>

<br>

And may you, who have already risen with Christ<br>

in Baptism through faith,<br>

by living in a right manner on this earth,<br>

be united with him in the homeland of heaven.<br>

<br>

Amen.<br>

<br>

And may the blessing of almighty God,<br>

the Father, and the Son, + and the Holy Spirit,<br>

come down on you and remain with you for ever.<br>

<br>

Amen.</p>
