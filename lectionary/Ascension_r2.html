<h3>The Ascension of the Lord<br> Lectionary: 58</h3>

<h4>Reading 2 <a href="/bible/ephesians/1:17">Eph 1:17-23</a></h4>
<div class="poetry">
<p>Brothers and sisters:<br>
May the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory,<br>
give you a Spirit of wisdom and revelation<br>
resulting in knowledge of him.<br>
May the eyes of your hearts be enlightened,<br>
that you may know what is the hope that belongs to his call,<br>
what are the riches of glory<br>
in his inheritance among the holy ones,<br>
and what is the surpassing greatness of his power<br>
for us who believe,<br>
in accord with the exercise of his great might,<br>
which he worked in Christ,<br>
raising him from the dead<br>
and seating him at his right hand in the heavens,<br>
far above every principality, authority, power, and dominion,<br>
and every name that is named<br>
not only in this age but also in the one to come.<br>
And he put all things beneath his feet<br>
and gave him as head over all things to the church,<br>
which is his body,<br>
the fullness of the one who fills all things in every way.</p>
