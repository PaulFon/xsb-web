  <p>O God, who have made this most sacred night radiant with the<br>

splendor of the true light, grant, we pray, that we, who have known the<br>

mysteries of his light on earth, may also delight in his gladness in<br>

heaven. Who lives and reigns with you in the unity of the Holy Spirit,<br>

God, for ever and ever. R. Amen.</p>
