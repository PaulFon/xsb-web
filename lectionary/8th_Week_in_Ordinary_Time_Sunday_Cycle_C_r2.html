  <p>A reading from the First Letter <br>

of Saint Paul to the Corinthians: <br>

Brothers and sisters:<br>

When this which is corruptible clothes itself with incorruptibility<br>

and this which is mortal clothes itself with immortality,<br>

then the word that is written shall come about:<br>

Death is swallowed up in victory.<br>

Where, O death, is your victory?<br>

Where, O death, is your sting?<br>

The sting of death is sin,<br>

and the power of sin is the law.<br>

But thanks be to God who gives us the victory<br>

through our Lord Jesus Christ.<br>

Therefore, my beloved brothers and sisters,<br>

be firm, steadfast, always fully devoted to the work of the Lord,<br>

knowing that in the Lord your labor is not in vain.</p>
