  <p>By your help, we beseech you, Lord our God, <br>
may we walk eagerly in that same charity <br>
with which, out of love for the world, <br>
your Son handed himself over to death. <br>
Through our Lord Jesus Christ, your Son, <br>
who lives and reigns with you in the unity of the Holy Spirit, <br>
God, for ever and ever.</p>
