  <p>O God, who have commanded us <br>

to listen to your beloved Son, <br>

be pleased, we pray, <br>

to nourish us inwardly by your word, <br>

that, with spiritual sight made pure, <br>

we may rejoice to behold your glory. <br>

Through our Lord Jesus Christ, your Son, <br>

who lives and reigns with you in the unity of the Holy Spirit, <br>

God, for ever and ever. <br>

R. Amen.</p>
