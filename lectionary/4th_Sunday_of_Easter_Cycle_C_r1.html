  <p>A reading from the Acts of the Apostles<br>

Paul and Barnabas continued on from Perga<br>

and reached Antioch in Pisidia.<br>

On the sabbath they entered the synagogue and took their seats.<br>

Many Jews and worshipers who were converts to Judaism<br>

followed Paul and Barnabas, who spoke to them<br>

and urged them to remain faithful to the grace of God.<br>

On the following sabbath almost the whole city gathered<br>

to hear the word of the Lord.<br>

When the Jews saw the crowds, they were filled with jealousy<br>

and with violent abuse contradicted what Paul said.<br>

Both Paul and Barnabas spoke out boldly and said,<br>

“It was necessary that the word of God be spoken to you first,<br>

but since you reject it<br>

and condemn yourselves as unworthy of eternal life,<br>

we now turn to the Gentiles.<br>

For so the Lord has commanded us,<br>

I have made you a light to the Gentiles,<br>

that you may be an instrument of salvation<br>

to the ends of the earth.”<br>

The Gentiles were delighted when they heard this<br>

and glorified the word of the Lord.<br>

All who were destined for eternal life came to believe,<br>

and the word of the Lord continued to spread<br>

through the whole region.<br>

The Jews, however, incited the women of prominence who were worshipers<br>

and the leading men of the city,<br>

stirred up a persecution against Paul and Barnabas,<br>

and expelled them from their territory.<br>

So they shook the dust from their feet in protest against them,<br>

and went to Iconium.<br>

The disciples were filled with joy and the Holy Spirit.</p>
