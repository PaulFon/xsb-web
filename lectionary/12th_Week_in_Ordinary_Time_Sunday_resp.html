<h4>Responsorial Psalm <a href="/bible/psalms/69:8">Ps 69:8-10, 14, 17, 33-35</a></h4>
<div class="poetry">
<p>R. (14c) <strong>Lord, in your great love, answer me.</strong><br />
For your sake I bear insult,<br />
and shame covers my face.<br />
I have become an outcast to my brothers,<br />
a stranger to my mother's children,<br />
Because zeal for your house consumes me,<br />
and the insults of those who blaspheme you fall upon me.<br />
R. <strong>Lord, in your great love, answer me.</strong><br />
I pray to you, O LORD,<br />
for the time of your favor, O God!<br />
In your great kindness answer me<br />
with your constant help.<br />
Answer me, O LORD, for bounteous is your kindness;<br />
in your great mercy turn toward me.<br />
R. <strong>Lord, in your great love, answer me.</strong><br />
“See, you lowly ones, and be glad;<br />
you who seek God, may your hearts revive!<br />
For the LORD hears the poor,<br />
and his own who are in bonds he spurns not.<br />
Let the heavens and the earth praise him,<br />
the seas and whatever moves in them!’‘<br />
R. <strong>Lord, in your great love, answer me.</strong></p>
