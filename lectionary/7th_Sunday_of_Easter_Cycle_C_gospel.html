  <p>A reading from the Gospel according to John<br>

Lifting up his eyes to heaven, Jesus prayed saying:<br>

“Holy Father, I pray not only for them,<br>

but also for those who will believe in me through their word,<br>

so that they may all be one,<br>

as you, Father, are in me and I in you,<br>

that they also may be in us,<br>

that the world may believe that you sent me.<br>

And I have given them the glory you gave me,<br>

so that they may be one, as we are one,<br>

I in them and you in me,<br>

that they may be brought to perfection as one,<br>

that the world may know that you sent me,<br>

and that you loved them even as you loved me.<br>

Father, they are your gift to me.<br>

I wish that where I am they also may be with me,<br>

that they may see my glory that you gave me,<br>

because you loved me before the foundation of the world.<br>

Righteous Father, the world also does not know you,<br>

but I know you, and they know that you sent me.<br>

I made known to them your name and I will make it known,<br>

that the love with which you loved me<br>

may be in them and I in them.”</p>
