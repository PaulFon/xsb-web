  <p>A reading from the holy Gospel according to Luke. <br>

R. Glory to you, O Lord.<br>

The crowds asked John the Baptist,<br>

“What should we do?”<br>

He said to them in reply,<br>

“Whoever has two cloaks<br>

should share with the person who has none. <br>

And whoever has food should do likewise.”<br>

Even tax collectors came to be baptized and they said to him,<br>

“Teacher, what should we do?”<br>

He answered them, <br>

“Stop collecting more than what is prescribed.”<br>

Soldiers also asked him,<br>

“And what is it that we should do?”<br>

He told them,<br>

“Do not practice extortion, <br>

do not falsely accuse anyone, <br>

and be satisfied with your wages.”<br>

<br>

Now the people were filled with expectation, <br>

and all were asking in their hearts <br>

whether John might be the Christ.<br>

John answered them all, saying, <br>

“I am baptizing you with water,<br>

but one mightier than I is coming.<br>

I am not worthy to loosen the thongs of his sandals.<br>

He will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and fire.<br>

His winnowing fan is in his hand to clear his threshing floor<br>

and to gather the wheat into his barn, <br>

but the chaff he will burn with unquenchable fire.”<br>

Exhorting them in many other ways, <br>

he preached good news to the people.</p>
