<div class="poetry">
<p>R. (5a) <strong>Lord, you are good and forgiving.</strong><br />
You, O LORD, are good and forgiving,<br />
abounding in kindness to all who call upon you.<br />
Hearken, O LORD, to my prayer<br />
and attend to the sound of my pleading.<br />
R. <strong>Lord, you are good and forgiving.</strong><br />
All the nations you have made shall come<br />
and worship you, O LORD,<br />
and glorify your name.<br />
For you are great, and you do wondrous deeds;<br />
you alone are God.<br />
R. <strong>Lord, you are good and forgiving.</strong><br />
You, O LORD, are a God merciful and gracious,<br />
slow to anger, abounding in kindness and fidelity.<br />
Turn toward me, and have pity on me;<br />
give your strength to your servant.<br />
R. <strong>Lord, you are good and forgiving.</strong></p>
