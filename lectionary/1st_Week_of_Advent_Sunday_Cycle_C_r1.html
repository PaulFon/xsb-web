  <p>A reading from the book of the Prophet Jeremiah: <br>

The days are coming, says the LORD, <br>

    when I will fulfill the promise <br>

    I made to the house of Israel and Judah.<br>

In those days, in that time, <br>

    I will raise up for David a just shoot ; <br>

    he shall do what is right and just in the land.<br>

In those days Judah shall be safe <br>

    and Jerusalem shall dwell secure; <br>

    this is what they shall call her: <br>

    “The LORD our justice.”</p>
