  <p>A reading from the holy Gospel according to Luke.<br>

In those days a decree went out from Caesar Augustus<br>

that the whole world should be enrolled.<br>

This was the first enrollment, <br>

when Quirinius was governor of Syria.<br>

So all went to be enrolled, each to his own town.<br>

And Joseph too went up from Galilee from the town of Nazareth <br>

to Judea, to the city of David that is called Bethlehem, <br>

because he was of the house and family of David, <br>

to be enrolled with Mary, his betrothed, who was with child.<br>

While they were there,<br>

the time came for her to have her child, <br>

and she gave birth to her firstborn son.<br>

She wrapped him in swaddling clothes and laid him in a manger, <br>

because there was no room for them in the inn.<br>

<br>

Now there were shepherds in that region living in the fields <br>

and keeping the night watch over their flock.<br>

The angel of the Lord appeared to them <br>

and the glory of the Lord shone around them, <br>

and they were struck with great fear.<br>

The angel said to them,<br>

“Do not be afraid;<br>

for behold, I proclaim to you good news of great joy <br>

that will be for all the people.<br>

For today in the city of David <br>

a savior has been born for you who is Christ and Lord.<br>

And this will be a sign for you: <br>

you will find an infant wrapped in swaddling clothes <br>

and lying in a manger.”<br>

And suddenly there was a multitude of the heavenly host with the angel,<br>

praising God and saying:<br>

    “Glory to God in the highest<br>

        and on earth peace to those on whom his favor rests.”</p>
