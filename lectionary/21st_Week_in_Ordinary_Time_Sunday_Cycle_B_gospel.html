  <p>Many of Jesus’ disciples who were listening said,<br>

“This saying is hard; who can accept it?”<br>

Since Jesus knew that his disciples were murmuring about this,<br>

he said to them, “Does this shock you?<br>

What if you were to see the Son of Man ascending<br>

to where he was before? <br>

It is the spirit that gives life,<br>

while the flesh is of no avail.<br>

The words I have spoken to you are Spirit and life.<br>

But there are some of you who do not believe.”<br>

Jesus knew from the beginning the ones who would not believe<br>

and the one who would betray him. <br>

And he said,<br>

“For this reason I have told you that no one can come to me<br>

unless it is granted him by my Father.”<br>

<br>

As a result of this,<br>

many of his disciples returned to their former way of life<br>

and no longer accompanied him.<br>

Jesus then said to the Twelve, “Do you also want to leave?” <br>

Simon Peter answered him, “Master, to whom shall we go? <br>

You have the words of eternal life. <br>

We have come to believe<br>

and are convinced that you are the Holy One of God.”</p>
