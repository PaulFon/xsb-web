<div class="poetry">
<p>The LORD appeared to Solomon in a dream at night.<br />
God said, “Ask something of me and I will give it to you.”<br />
Solomon answered:<br />
“O LORD, my God, you have made me, your servant, king<br />
to succeed my father David;<br />
but I am a mere youth, not knowing at all how to act.<br />
I serve you in the midst of the people whom you have chosen,<br />
a people so vast that it cannot be numbered or counted.<br />
Give your servant, therefore, an understanding heart<br />
to judge your people and to distinguish right from wrong.<br />
For who is able to govern this vast people of yours?”</p>
<p>The LORD was pleased that Solomon made this request.<br />
So God said to him:<br />
“Because you have asked for this—<br />
not for a long life for yourself,<br />
nor for riches,<br />
nor for the life of your enemies,<br />
but for understanding so that you may know what is right—<br />
I do as you requested.<br />
I give you a heart so wise and understanding<br />
that there has never been anyone like you up to now,<br />
and after you there will come no one to equal you.”</p>
