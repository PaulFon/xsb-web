  <p>A reading from the book of Revelation<br>

The angel took me in spirit to a great, high mountain<br>

and showed me the holy city Jerusalem<br>

coming down out of heaven from God.<br>

It gleamed with the splendor of God.<br>

Its radiance was like that of a precious stone,<br>

like jasper, clear as crystal.<br>

It had a massive, high wall,<br>

with twelve gates where twelve angels were stationed<br>

and on which names were inscribed,<br>

the names of the twelve tribes of the Israelites.<br>

There were three gates facing east,<br>

three north, three south, and three west.<br>

The wall of the city had twelve courses of stones as its foundation,<br>

on which were inscribed the twelve names<br>

of the twelve apostles of the Lamb.<br>

<br>

I saw no temple in the city<br>

for its temple is the Lord God almighty and the Lamb.<br>

The city had no need of sun or moon to shine on it,<br>

for the glory of God gave it light,<br>

and its lamp was the Lamb.</p>
