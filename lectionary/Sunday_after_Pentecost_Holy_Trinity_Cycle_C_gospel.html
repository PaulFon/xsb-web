  <p>A reading from the Gospel of John<br>

Jesus said to his disciples:<br>

"I have much more to tell you, but you cannot bear it now.<br>

But when he comes, the Spirit of truth,<br>

he will guide you to all truth.<br>

He will not speak on his own,<br>

but he will speak what he hears,<br>

and will declare to you the things that are coming.<br>

He will glorify me,<br>

because he will take from what is mine and declare it to you.<br>

Everything that the Father has is mine;<br>

for this reason I told you that he will take from what is mine<br>

and declare it to you."</p>
