  <p>Let us pray.<br>

<br>

<br>

<br>

And all pray in silence with the Priest for a while.<br>

<br>

<br>

<br>

O God, who in this wonderful Sacrament<br>

<br>

have left us a memorial of your Passion,<br>

<br>

grant us, we pray,<br>

<br>

so to revere the sacred mysteries of your Body and Blood <br>

<br>

that we may always experience in ourselves<br>

<br>

the fruits of your redemption.<br>

<br>

<br>

<br>

Who live and reign with God the Father<br>

<br>

in the unity of the Holy Spirit,<br>

<br>

one God, for ever and ever.</p>
