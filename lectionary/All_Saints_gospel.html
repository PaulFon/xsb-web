  <p>A reading from the holy Gospel according to Matthew. When Jesus saw the crowds, he went up the mountain,<br>

and after he had sat down, his disciples came to him. <br>

He began to teach them, saying:<br>

<br>

    “Blessed are the poor in spirit,<br>

        for theirs is the Kingdom of heaven.<br>

    Blessed are they who mourn,<br>

        for they will be comforted.<br>

    Blessed are the meek,<br>

        for they will inherit the land.<br>

    Blessed are they who hunger and thirst for righteousness,<br>

        for they will be satisfied.<br>

    Blessed are the merciful,<br>

        for they will be shown mercy.<br>

    Blessed are the clean of heart,<br>

        for they will see God.<br>

    Blessed are the peacemakers,<br>

        for they will be called children of God.<br>

    Blessed are they who are persecuted for the sake of righteousness,<br>

        for theirs is the Kingdom of heaven.<br>

    Blessed are you when they insult you and persecute you<br>

        and utter every kind of evil against you falsely because of me.<br>

    Rejoice and be glad,<br>

        for your reward will be great in heaven.”</p>
