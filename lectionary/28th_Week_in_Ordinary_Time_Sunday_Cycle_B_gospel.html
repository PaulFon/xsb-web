  <p>A reading from the holy Gospel according to Mark. R. Glory to you, O Lord. <br>

As Jesus was setting out on a journey, a man ran up,<br>

knelt down before him, and asked him,<br>

"Good teacher, what must I do to inherit eternal life?"<br>

Jesus answered him, "Why do you call me good? <br>

No one is good but God alone.<br>

You know the commandments: You shall not kill;<br>

you shall not commit adultery;<br>

you shall not steal;<br>

you shall not bear false witness;<br>

you shall not defraud;<br>

honor your father and your mother." <br>

He replied and said to him,<br>

"Teacher, all of these I have observed from my youth."<br>

Jesus, looking at him, loved him and said to him,<br>

"You are lacking in one thing.<br>

Go, sell what you have, and give to the poor<br>

and you will have treasure in heaven; then come, follow me." <br>

At that statement his face fell,<br>

and he went away sad, for he had many possessions.<br>

<br>

Jesus looked around and said to his disciples,<br>

"How hard it is for those who have wealth<br>

to enter the kingdom of God!" <br>

The disciples were amazed at his words.<br>

So Jesus again said to them in reply,<br>

"Children, how hard it is to enter the kingdom of God! <br>

It is easier for a camel to pass through the eye of a needle<br>

than for one who is rich to enter the kingdom of God." <br>

They were exceedingly astonished and said among themselves,<br>

"Then who can be saved?"<br>

Jesus looked at them and said,<br>

"For human beings it is impossible, but not for God. <br>

All things are possible for God." <br>

Peter began to say to him,<br>

"We have given up everything and followed you." <br>

Jesus said, "Amen, I say to you,<br>

there is no one who has given up house or brothers or sisters<br>

or mother or father or children or lands<br>

for my sake and for the sake of the gospel<br>

who will not receive a hundred times more now in this present age:<br>

houses and brothers and sisters<br>

and mothers and children and lands,<br>

with persecutions, and eternal life in the age to come."<br>
