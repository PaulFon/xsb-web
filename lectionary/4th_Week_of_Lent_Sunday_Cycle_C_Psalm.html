  <p>R. Taste and see the goodness of the Lord.<br>

I will bless the LORD at all times;<br>

his praise shall be ever in my mouth.<br>

Let my soul glory in the LORD;<br>

the lowly will hear me and be glad.<br>

R. Taste and see the goodness of the Lord.<br>

Glorify the LORD with me,<br>

let us together extol his name.<br>

I sought the LORD, and he answered me<br>

and delivered me from all my fears.<br>

R. Taste and see the goodness of the Lord.<br>

Look to him that you may be radiant with joy,<br>

and your faces may not blush with shame.<br>

When the poor one called out, the LORD heard,<br>

and from all his distress he saved him.<br>

R. Taste and see the goodness of the Lord.</p>
