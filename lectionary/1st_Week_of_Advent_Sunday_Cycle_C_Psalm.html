  <p>R. (1b)  To you, O Lord, I lift my soul.<br>

Your ways, O LORD, make known to me;<br>

   teach me your paths,<br>

Guide me in your truth and teach me,<br>

   for you are God my savior,<br>

   and for you I wait all the day. <br>

R. To you, O Lord, I lift my soul.<br>

Good and upright is the LORD;<br>

   thus he shows sinners the way.<br>

He guides the humble to justice,<br>

   and teaches the humble his way. <br>

R. To you, O Lord, I lift my soul.<br>

All the paths of the LORD are kindness and constancy<br>

   toward those who keep his covenant and his decrees.<br>

The friendship of the LORD is with those who fear him,<br>

   and his covenant, for their instruction. <br>

R. To you, O Lord, I lift my soul.</p>
