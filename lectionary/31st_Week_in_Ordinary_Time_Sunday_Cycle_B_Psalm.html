  <p>R. I love you, Lord, my strength.<br>

I love you, O LORD, my strength,<br>

    O LORD, my rock, my fortress, my deliverer.<br>

R. I love you, Lord, my strength.<br>

My God, my rock of refuge,<br>

    my shield, the horn of my salvation, my stronghold!<br>

Praised be the LORD, I exclaim,<br>

    and I am safe from my enemies.<br>

R. I love you, Lord, my strength.<br>

The LORD lives!  And blessed be my rock!<br>

    Extolled be God my savior.<br>

You who gave great victories to your king<br>

    and showed kindness to your anointed.<br>

R. I love you, Lord, my strength.</p>
