  <p>Having received the Sacrament of your Only Begotten Son, who was sacrificed for us and rose in glory, we humbly implore you, O Lord, for your departed servants, that, cleansed by the paschal mysteries, they may glory in the gift of the resurrection to come. Through Christ our Lord. R. Amen.</p>
