  <p>A reading from the Book of Daniel: <br>

As the visions during the night continued, I saw<br>

    one like a Son of man coming,<br>

        on the clouds of heaven;<br>

    when he reached the Ancient One<br>

        and was presented before him,<br>

    the one like a Son of man received dominion, glory, and kingship;<br>

        all peoples, nations, and languages serve him.<br>

    His dominion is an everlasting dominion<br>

        that shall not be taken away,<br>

        his kingship shall not be destroyed.</p>
