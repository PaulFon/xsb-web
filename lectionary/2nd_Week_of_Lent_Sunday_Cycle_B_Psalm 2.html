  <p>R. I Will Walk before the Lord, in the Land of the Living. <br>
I believed, even when I said, <br>
"I am greatly afflicted." <br>
Precious in the eyes of the Lord <br>
is the death of his faithful ones. <br>
R. I will walk before the Lord, in the land of the living. <br>
O Lord, I am your servant; <br>
I am your servant, the son of your handmaid; <br>
you have loosed my bonds. <br>
To you will I offer sacrifice of thanksgiving,<br>
and I will call upon the name of the Lord. <br>
R. I will walk before the Lord, in the land of the living. <br>
My vows to the Lord I will pay <br>
in the presence of all his people, <br>
In the courts of the house of the Lord, <br>
in your midst, O Jerusalem. <br>
R. I will walk before the Lord, in the land of the living.</p>
