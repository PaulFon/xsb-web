<div class="poetry">
<p>At that time Jesus exclaimed:<br />
“I give praise to you, Father, Lord of heaven and earth,<br />
for although you have hidden these things<br />
from the wise and the learned<br />
you have revealed them to the childlike.<br />
Yes, Father, such has been your gracious will.<br />
All things have been handed over to me by my Father.<br />
No one knows the Son except the Father,<br />
and no one knows the Father except the Son<br />
and anyone to whom the Son wishes to reveal him.”</p>
