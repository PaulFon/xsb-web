  <p>O God, who have prepared for those <br class="sline">
    who love you good things which <br class="sline">
    no eye can see, fill our hearts, <br class="sline">
    we pray, with the warmth of your love, <br class="sline">
    so that, loving you in all things <br class="sline">
    and above all things, we may attain your promises, <br class="sline">
    which surpass every human desire. <br class="sline">
    Through our Lord Jesus Christ, your Son, <br class="sline">
    who lives and reigns with you <br class="sline">
    in the unity of the Holy Spirit, <br class="sline">
    one God, for ever and ever. <br class="sline">
    R. Amen.</p>
