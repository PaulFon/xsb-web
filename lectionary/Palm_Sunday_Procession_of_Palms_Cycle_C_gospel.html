  <p>Jesus proceeded on his journey up to Jerusalem.<br>

As he drew near to Bethphage and Bethany<br>

at the place called the Mount of Olives,<br>

he sent two of his disciples.<br>

He said, “Go into the village opposite you,<br>

and as you enter it you will find a colt tethered<br>

on which no one has ever sat.<br>

Untie it and bring it here.<br>

And if anyone should ask you,<br>

‘Why are you untying it?’<br>

you will answer,<br>

‘The Master has need of it.’”<br>

So those who had been sent went off<br>

and found everything just as he had told them.<br>

And as they were untying the colt, its owners said to them,<br>

“Why are you untying this colt?”<br>

They answered,<br>

“The Master has need of it.”<br>

So they brought it to Jesus,<br>

threw their cloaks over the colt,<br>

and helped Jesus to mount.<br>

As he rode along,<br>

the people were spreading their cloaks on the road;<br>

and now as he was approaching the slope of the Mount of Olives,<br>

the whole multitude of his disciples<br>

began to praise God aloud with joy<br>

for all the mighty deeds they had seen.<br>

They proclaimed:<br>

            “Blessed is the king who comes<br>

                        in the name of the Lord.<br>

            Peace in heaven<br>

                        and glory in the highest.”<br>

Some of the Pharisees in the crowd said to him,<br>

“Teacher, rebuke your disciples.”<br>

He said in reply,<br>

“I tell you, if they keep silent,<br>

the stones will cry out!”</p>
