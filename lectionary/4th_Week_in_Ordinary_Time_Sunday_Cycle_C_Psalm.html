  <p>R. I will sing of your salvation.<br>

In you, O LORD, I take refuge;<br>

let me never be put to shame.<br>

In your justice rescue me, and deliver me;<br>

incline your ear to me, and save me.<br>

R. I will sing of your salvation.<br>

Be my rock of refuge,<br>

a stronghold to give me safety,<br>

for you are my rock and my fortress.<br>

O my God, rescue me from the hand of the wicked.<br>

R. I will sing of your salvation.<br>

For you are my hope, O Lord;<br>

my trust, O God, from my youth.<br>

On you I depend from birth;<br>

from my mother’s womb you are my strength.<br>

R. I will sing of your salvation.<br>

My mouth shall declare your justice,<br>

day by day your salvation.<br>

O God, you have taught me from my youth,<br>

and till the present I proclaim your wondrous deeds.<br>

R. I will sing of your salvation.</p>
