  <p>A Reading from the Acts of the Apostles<br>

 When the captain and the court officers had brought the apostles in<br>

and made them stand before the Sanhedrin,<br>

the high priest questioned them,<br>

“We gave you strict orders, did we not,<br>

to stop teaching in that name?<br>

Yet you have filled Jerusalem with your teaching<br>

and want to bring this man’s blood upon us.”<br>

But Peter and the apostles said in reply,<br>

“We must obey God rather than men.<br>

The God of our ancestors raised Jesus,<br>

though you had him killed by hanging him on a tree.<br>

God exalted him at his right hand as leader and savior<br>

to grant Israel repentance and forgiveness of sins.<br>

We are witnesses of these things,<br>

as is the Holy Spirit whom God has given to those who obey him.”<br>

The Sanhedrin ordered the apostles<br>

to stop speaking in the name of Jesus, and dismissed them.<br>

So they left the presence of the Sanhedrin,<br>

rejoicing that they had been found worthy<br>

to suffer dishonor for the sake of the name.</p>
