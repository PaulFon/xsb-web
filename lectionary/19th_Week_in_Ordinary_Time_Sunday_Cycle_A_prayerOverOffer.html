      <p>Be pleased, O Lord, to accept <br class="sline">
          the offerings of your Church, <br class="sline">
          for in your mercy you have given them to be offered <br class="sline">
          and by your power you transform them <br class="sline">
          into the mystery of our salvation. </p>
          <p>Through Christ our Lord. <br class="sline">
        R. Amen.</p>
