  <p>A reading from the Letter of Saint Paul to the Romans: Brothers and sisters:<br>

Are you unaware that we who were baptized into Christ Jesus <br>

were baptized into his death?<br>

We were indeed buried with him through baptism into death, <br>

so that, just as Christ was raised from the dead <br>

by the glory of the Father, <br>

we too might live in newness of life.<br>

<br>

For if we have grown into union with him through a death like his, <br>

we shall also be united with him in the resurrection.<br>

We know that our old self was crucified with him, <br>

so that our sinful body might be done away with, <br>

that we might no longer be in slavery to sin.<br>

For a dead person has been absolved from sin.<br>

If, then, we have died with Christ,<br>

we believe that we shall also live with him.<br>

We know that Christ, raised from the dead, dies no more;<br>

death no longer has power over him.</p>
