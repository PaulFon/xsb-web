  <p>R.    (10bc)  The queen stands at your right hand, arrayed in gold.<br>

The queen takes her place at your right hand in gold of Ophir.<br>

R.    The queen stands at your right hand, arrayed in gold.<br>

Hear, O daughter, and see; turn your ear,<br>

    forget your people and your father’s house.<br>

R.    The queen stands at your right hand, arrayed in gold.<br>

So shall the king desire your beauty;<br>

    for he is your lord.<br>

R.    The queen stands at your right hand, arrayed in gold.<br>

They are borne in with gladness and joy;<br>

    they enter the palace of the king.<br>

R.    The queen stands at your right hand, arrayed in gold.</p>
