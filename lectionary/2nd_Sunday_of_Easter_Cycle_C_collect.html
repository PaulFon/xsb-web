  <p>God of everlasting mercy,<br>

who in the very recurrence of the paschal feast<br>

kindle the faith of the people you have made your own,<br>

increase, we pray, the grace you have bestowed,<br>

that all may grasp and rightly understand<br>

in what font they have been washed,<br>

by whose Spirit they have been reborn,<br>

by whose Blood they have been redeemed.<br>

<br>

Through our Lord Jesus Christ, your Son,<br>

who lives and reigns with you in the unity of the Holy Spirit,<br>

one God, for ever and ever.</p>
