  <p>A reading from the Acts of the Apostles: <br>

Peter proceeded to speak to those gathered<br>

in the house of Cornelius, saying: <br>

“In truth, I see that God shows no partiality.<br>

Rather, in every nation whoever fears him and acts uprightly<br>

is acceptable to him.<br>

You know the word that he sent to the Israelites <br>

as he proclaimed peace through Jesus Christ, who is Lord of all, <br>

what has happened all over Judea, <br>

beginning in Galilee after the baptism<br>

that John preached, <br>

how God anointed Jesus of Nazareth<br>

with the Holy Spirit and power.<br>

He went about doing good <br>

and healing all those oppressed by the devil, <br>

for God was with him.”<br>

<br>

OR: <br>

<br>

Ti 2:11-14; 3:4-7<br>

<br>

Beloved:<br>

The grace of God has appeared, saving all<br>

and training us to reject godless ways and worldly desires<br>

and to live temperately, justly, and devoutly in this age,<br>

as we await the blessed hope,<br>

the appearance of the glory of our great God<br>

and savior Jesus Christ,<br>

who gave himself for us to deliver us from all lawlessness<br>

and to cleanse for himself a people as his own,<br>

eager to do what is good.<br>

<br>

            When the kindness and generous love<br>

                        of God our savior appeared,<br>

            not because of any righteous deeds we had done<br>

                        but because of his mercy,<br>

            He saved us through the bath of rebirth<br>

                        and renewal by the Holy Spirit,<br>

            whom he richly poured out on us<br>

                        through Jesus Christ our savior,<br>

            so that we might be justified by his grace<br>

                        and become heirs in hope of eternal life.</p>
