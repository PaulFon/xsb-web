  <p>R. The Lord Upholds My Life. O God, by your name save me, and by your might defend my cause. O God, hear my prayer; hearken to the words of my mouth. R. The Lord upholds my life. For the haughty men have risen up against me, the ruthless seek my life; they set not God before their eyes. R. The Lord upholds my life. Behold, God is my helper; the Lord sustains my life. Freely will I offer you sacrifice; I will praise your name, O Lord, for its goodness. R. The Lord upholds my life.</p>
