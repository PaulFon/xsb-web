  <p>A reading from the Book of the Prophet Isaiah:<br>

The people who walked in darkness<br>

        have seen a great light;<br>

    upon those who dwelt in the land of gloom<br>

        a light has shone.<br>

    You have brought them abundant joy<br>

        and great rejoicing,<br>

    as they rejoice before you as at the harvest,<br>

        as people make merry when dividing spoils.<br>

    For the yoke that burdened them,<br>

        the pole on their shoulder,<br>

    and the rod of their taskmaster<br>

        you have smashed, as on the day of Midian.<br>

    For every boot that tramped in battle,<br>

        every cloak rolled in blood,<br>

        will be burned as fuel for flames.<br>

    For a child is born to us, a son is given us;<br>

        upon his shoulder dominion rests.<br>

    They name him Wonder-Counselor, God-Hero,<br>

        Father-Forever, Prince of Peace.<br>

    His dominion is vast<br>

        and forever peaceful,<br>

    from David’s throne, and over his kingdom,<br>

        which he confirms and sustains<br>

    by judgment and justice,<br>

        both now and forever.<br>

    The zeal of the LORD of hosts will do this!</p>
