<div class="poetry">
<p>Hear the word of the LORD,<br />
princes of Sodom!<br />
Listen to the instruction of our God,<br />
people of Gomorrah!<br />
What care I for the number of your sacrifices?<br />
says the LORD.<br />
I have had enough of whole-burnt rams<br />
and fat of fatlings;<br />
In the blood of calves, lambs and goats<br />
I find no pleasure.</p>
<p>When you come in to visit me,<br />
who asks these things of you?<br />
Trample my courts no more!<br />
Bring no more worthless offerings;<br />
your incense is loathsome to me.<br />
New moon and sabbath, calling of assemblies,<br />
octaves with wickedness: these I cannot bear.<br />
Your new moons and festivals I detest;<br />
they weigh me down, I tire of the load.<br />
When you spread out your hands,<br />
I close my eyes to you;<br />
Though you pray the more,<br />
I will not listen.<br />
Your hands are full of blood!<br />
Wash yourselves clean!<br />
Put away your misdeeds from before my eyes;<br />
cease doing evil; learn to do good.<br />
Make justice your aim: redress the wronged,<br />
hear the orphan’s plea, defend the widow.</p>
