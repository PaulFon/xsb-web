  <p>May the splendor of your majesty, O Lord, we pray, <br>

shed its light upon our hearts,<br>

that we may pass through the shadows of this world<br>

and reach the brightness of our eternal home.<br>

Through our Lord Jesus Christ, your Son,<br>

who lives and reigns with you in the unity of the Holy Spirit,<br>

one God, for ever and ever.</p>
