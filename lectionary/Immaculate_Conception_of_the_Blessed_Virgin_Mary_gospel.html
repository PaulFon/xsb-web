  <p>A reading from the holy Gospel according to Luke.<br>

The angel Gabriel was sent from God<br>

to a town of Galilee called Nazareth,<br>

to a virgin betrothed to a man named Joseph,<br>

of the house of David,<br>

and the virgin’s name was Mary.<br>

And coming to her, he said,<br>

“Hail, full of grace! The Lord is with you.”<br>

But she was greatly troubled at what was said<br>

and pondered what sort of greeting this might be.<br>

Then the angel said to her,<br>

“Do not be afraid, Mary,<br>

for you have found favor with God.<br>

Behold, you will conceive in your womb and bear a son,<br>

and you shall name him Jesus.<br>

He will be great and will be called Son of the Most High,<br>

and the Lord God will give him the throne of David his father,<br>

and he will rule over the house of Jacob forever,<br>

and of his Kingdom there will be no end.”<br>

But Mary said to the angel,<br>

“How can this be,<br>

since I have no relations with a man?”<br>

And the angel said to her in reply,<br>

“The Holy Spirit will come upon you,<br>

and the power of the Most High will overshadow you.<br>

Therefore the child to be born<br>

will be called holy, the Son of God.<br>

And behold, Elizabeth, your relative,<br>

has also conceived a son in her old age,<br>

and this is the sixth month for her who was called barren;<br>

for nothing will be impossible for God.”<br>

Mary said, “Behold, I am the handmaid of the Lord.<br>

May it be done to me according to your word.”<br>

Then the angel departed from her.</p>
