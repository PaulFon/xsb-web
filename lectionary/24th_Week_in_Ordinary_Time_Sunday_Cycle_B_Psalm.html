  <p>R. I Will Walk Before the Lord, in the Land of the Living. Or: R. Alleluia. I love the Lord because he has heard     my voice in supplication, because he has inclined his ear to me the day I called. R. I will walk before the Lord, in the land of the living. Or: R.    Alleluia. The cords of death encompassed me; the snares of the netherworld seized upon me; I fell into distress and sorrow, And I called upon the name of the Lord, "O Lord, save my life!" R. I will walk before the Lord, in the land of the living. Or: R. Alleluia. Gracious is the Lord and just; yes, our God is merciful. The Lord keeps the little ones; I was brought low, and he saved me. R. I will walk before the Lord, in the land of the living. Or: R. Alleluia. For he has freed my soul from death, my eyes from tears, my feet from stumbling. I shall walk before the Lord in the land of the living. R. I will walk before the Lord, in the land of the living. Or: R. Alleluia.</p>
