<div class="poetry">
<p>Jesus said to his apostles:<br />
“Whoever loves father or mother more than me is not worthy of me,<br />
and whoever loves son or daughter more than me is not worthy of me;<br />
and whoever does not take up his cross<br />
and follow after me is not worthy of me.<br />
Whoever finds his life will lose it,<br />
and whoever loses his life for my sake will find it.</p>
<p>&quot;Whoever receives you receives me,<br />
and whoever receives me receives the one who sent me.<br />
Whoever receives a prophet because he is a prophet<br />
will receive a prophet’s reward,<br />
and whoever receives a righteous man<br />
because he is a righteous man<br />
will receive a righteous man’s reward.<br />
And whoever gives only a cup of cold water<br />
to one of these little ones to drink<br />
because the little one is a disciple—<br />
amen, I say to you, he will surely not lose his reward.”</p>
