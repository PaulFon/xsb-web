  <p>A reading from the book of Exodus<br>

Moses was tending the flock of his father-in-law Jethro,<br>

the priest of Midian.<br>

Leading the flock across the desert, he came to Horeb,<br>

the mountain of God.<br>

There an angel of the LORD appeared to Moses in fire<br>

flaming out of a bush.<br>

As he looked on, he was surprised to see that the bush,<br>

though on fire, was not consumed.<br>

So Moses decided,<br>

“I must go over to look at this remarkable sight,<br>

and see why the bush is not burned.”<br>

<br>

When the LORD saw him coming over to look at it more closely,<br>

God called out to him from the bush, "Moses! Moses!”<br>

He answered, “Here I am.”<br>

God said, “Come no nearer!<br>

Remove the sandals from your feet,<br>

for the place where you stand is holy ground.<br>

I am the God of your fathers, “ he continued,<br>

“the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, the God of Jacob.”<br>

Moses hid his face, for he was afraid to look at God.<br>

But the LORD said,<br>

“I have witnessed the affliction of my people in Egypt<br>

and have heard their cry of complaint against their slave drivers,<br>

so I know well what they are suffering.<br>

Therefore I have come down to rescue them<br>

from the hands of the Egyptians<br>

and lead them out of that land into a good and spacious land,<br>

a land flowing with milk and honey.”<br>

<br>

Moses said to God, “But when I go to the Israelites<br>

and say to them, ‘The God of your fathers has sent me to you,’<br>

if they ask me, ‘What is his name?’ what am I to tell them?”<br>

God replied, “I am who am.”<br>

Then he added, “This is what you shall tell the Israelites:<br>

I AM sent me to you.”<br>

<br>

God spoke further to Moses, “Thus shall you say to the Israelites:<br>

The LORD, the God of your fathers,<br>

the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, the God of Jacob,<br>

has sent me to you.<br>

<br>

“This is my name forever;<br>

thus am I to be remembered through all generations.”</p>
