  <p>A reading from the first Letter of <br>

Saint Paul to the Corinthians: <br>

Brothers and sisters: <br>

Brothers and sisters:<br>

If Christ is preached as raised from the dead,<br>

how can some among you say there is no resurrection of the dead?<br>

If the dead are not raised, neither has Christ been raised,<br>

and if Christ has not been raised, your faith is vain;<br>

you are still in your sins.<br>

Then those who have fallen asleep in Christ have perished.<br>

If for this life only we have hoped in Christ,<br>

we are the most pitiable people of all.<br>

But now Christ has been raised from the dead,<br>

the firstfruits of those who have fallen asleep.</p>
