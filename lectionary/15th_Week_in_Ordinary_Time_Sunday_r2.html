<div class="poetry">
<p>Brothers and sisters:<br />
I consider that the sufferings of this present time are as nothing<br />
compared with the glory to be revealed for us.<br />
For creation awaits with eager expectation<br />
the revelation of the children of God;<br />
for creation was made subject to futility,<br />
not of its own accord but because of the one who subjected it,<br />
in hope that creation itself<br />
would be set free from slavery to corruption<br />
and share in the glorious freedom of the children of God.<br />
We know that all creation is groaning in labor pains even until now;<br />
and not only that, but we ourselves,<br />
who have the firstfruits of the Spirit,<br />
we also groan within ourselves<br />
as we wait for adoption, the redemption of our bodies. </html>
