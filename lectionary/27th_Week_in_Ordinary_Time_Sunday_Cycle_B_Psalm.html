  <p>R. May the Lord bless us all the days of our lives.<br>

Blessed are you who fear the LORD,<br>

    who walk in his ways!<br>

For you shall eat the fruit of your handiwork;<br>

    blessed shall you be, and favored.<br>

R. May the Lord bless us all the days of our lives.<br>

Your wife shall be like a fruitful vine<br>

    in the recesses of your home;<br>

your children like olive plants<br>

    around your table.<br>

R. May the Lord bless us all the days of our lives.<br>

Behold, thus is the man blessed<br>

    who fears the LORD.<br>

The LORD bless you from Zion:<br>

    may you see the prosperity of Jerusalem<br>

    all the days of your life.<br>

R. May the Lord bless us all the days of our lives.<br>

May you see your children's children.<br>

    Peace be upon Israel!<br>

R. May the Lord bless us all the days of our lives.</p>
