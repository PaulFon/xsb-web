<div class="poetry">
<p>Brothers and sisters:<br />
Are you unaware that we who were baptized into Christ Jesus<br />
were baptized into his death?<br />
We were indeed buried with him through baptism into death,<br />
so that, just as Christ was raised from the dead<br />
by the glory of the Father,<br />
we too might live in newness of life.</p>
<p>If, then, we have died with Christ,<br />
we believe that we shall also live with him.<br />
We know that Christ, raised from the dead, dies no more;<br />
death no longer has power over him.<br />
As to his death, he died to sin once and for all;<br />
as to his life, he lives for God.<br />
Consequently, you too must think of yourselves as dead to sin<br />
and living for God in Christ Jesus.</p>
