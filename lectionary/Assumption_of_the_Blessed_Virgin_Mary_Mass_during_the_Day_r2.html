  <p>A reading from the first letter of Saint Paul to the Corinthians. <br>

Brothers and sisters:<br>

Christ has been raised from the dead,<br>

the firstfruits of those who have fallen asleep.<br>

For since death came through man,<br>

the resurrection of the dead came also through man.<br>

For just as in Adam all die,<br>

so too in Christ shall all be brought to life,<br>

but each one in proper order:<br>

Christ the firstfruits;<br>

then, at his coming, those who belong to Christ;<br>

then comes the end,<br>

when he hands over the Kingdom to his God and Father,<br>

when he has destroyed every sovereignty<br>

and every authority and power.<br>

For he must reign until he has put all his enemies under his feet.<br>

The last enemy to be destroyed is death,<br>

for “he subjected everything under his feet.”</p>
