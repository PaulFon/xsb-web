  <p>Let us pray.<br>

<br>

God our Father, who by sending into the world<br>

<br>

the Word of truth and the Spirit of sanctification<br>

<br>

made known to the human race your wondrous mystery, <br>

<br>

grant us, we pray, that in professing the true faith,<br>

<br>

we may acknowledge the Trinity of eternal glory<br>

<br>

and adore your Unity, powerful in majesty.<br>

<br>

<br>

<br>

Through our Lord Jesus Christ, your Son,<br>

<br>

who lives and reigns with you in the unity of the Holy Spirit, <br>

<br>

one God, for ever and ever.</p>
