  <p>A reading from the holy Gospel according to Mark. R. Glory to you, O Lord. <br>

Jesus said to his disciples:<br>

"In those days after that tribulation<br>

the sun will be darkened,<br>

and the moon will not give its light,<br>

and the stars will be falling from the sky,<br>

and the powers in the heavens will be shaken.<br>

<br>

"And then they will see 'the Son of Man coming in the clouds'<br>

with great power and glory,<br>

and then he will send out the angels<br>

and gather his elect from the four winds,<br>

from the end of the earth to the end of the sky.<br>

<br>

"Learn a lesson from the fig tree.<br>

When its branch becomes tender and sprouts leaves,<br>

you know that summer is near.<br>

In the same way, when you see these things happening,<br>

know that he is near, at the gates. <br>

Amen, I say to you,<br>

this generation will not pass away<br>

until all these things have taken place. <br>

Heaven and earth will pass away,<br>

but my words will not pass away.<br>

"But of that day or hour, no one knows,<br>

neither the angels in heaven, nor the Son, but only the Father."</p>
