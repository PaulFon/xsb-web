  <p>R. Our Eyes are Fixed on the Lord, Pleading for His Mercy. To you I lift up my eyes who are enthroned in heaven—As the eyes of servants are on the hands of their masters. R. Our eyes are fixed on the Lord, pleading for his mercy. As the eyes of a maid are on the hands of her mistress, so are our eyes on the Lord, our God, till he have pity on us. R. Our eyes are fixed on the Lord, pleading for his mercy. Have pity on us, O Lord, have pity on us, for we are more than sated with contempt; our souls are more than sated with the mockery of the arrogant, with the contempt of the proud. R. Our eyes are fixed on the Lord, pleading for his mercy.</p>
