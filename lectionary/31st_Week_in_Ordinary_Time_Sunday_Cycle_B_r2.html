  <p>A reading from the letter of Saint Paul to the Hebrews: <br>

Brothers and sisters:<br>

The levitical priests were many<br>

because they were prevented by death from remaining in office,<br>

but Jesus, because he remains forever,<br>

has a priesthood that does not pass away.<br>

Therefore, he is always able to save those who approach God through him, <br>

since he lives forever to make intercession for them.<br>

<br>

It was fitting that we should have such a high priest:<br>

holy, innocent, undefiled, separated from sinners,<br>

higher than the heavens.<br>

He has no need, as did the high priests,<br>

to offer sacrifice day after day,<br>

first for his own sins and then for those of the people;<br>

he did that once for all when he offered himself. <br>

For the law appoints men subject to weakness to be high priests,<br>

but the word of the oath, which was taken after the law,<br>

appoints a son,<br>

who has been made perfect forever.</p>
