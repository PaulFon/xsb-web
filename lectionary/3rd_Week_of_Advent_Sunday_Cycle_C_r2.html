  <p>A reading from the First Letter of Saint Paul to the Philippians:<br>

Brothers and sisters:<br>

Rejoice in the Lord always.<br>

I shall say it again:  rejoice!<br>

Your kindness should be known to all.<br>

The Lord is near.<br>

Have no anxiety at all, but in everything, <br>

by prayer and petition, with thanksgiving, <br>

make your requests known to God.<br>

Then the peace of God that surpasses all understanding <br>

will guard your hearts and minds in Christ Jesus.</p>
