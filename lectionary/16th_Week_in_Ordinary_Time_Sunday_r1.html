<div class="poetry">
<p>There is no god besides you who have the care of all,<br />
that you need show you have not unjustly condemned.<br />
For your might is the source of justice;<br />
your mastery over all things makes you lenient to all.<br />
For you show your might when the perfection of your power is disbelieved;<br />
and in those who know you, you rebuke temerity.<br />
But though you are master of might, you judge with clemency,<br />
and with much lenience you govern us;<br />
for power, whenever you will, attends you.<br />
And you taught your people, by these deeds,<br />
that those who are just must be kind;<br />
and you gave your children good ground for hope<br />
that you would permit repentance for their sins.</p>
