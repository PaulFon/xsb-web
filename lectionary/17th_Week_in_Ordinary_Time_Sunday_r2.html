<p>Brothers and sisters:<br />
We know that all things work for good for those who love God,<br />
who are called according to his purpose.<br />
For those he foreknew he also predestined<br />
to be conformed to the image of his Son,<br />
so that he might be the firstborn<br />
among many brothers and sisters.<br />
And those he predestined he also called;<br />
and those he called he also justified;<br />
and those he justified he also glorified.</p>
