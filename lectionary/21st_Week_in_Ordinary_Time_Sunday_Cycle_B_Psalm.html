  <p>R. (9a)  Taste and see the goodness of the Lord.<br>

I will bless the LORD at all times;<br>

       his praise shall be ever in my mouth.<br>

Let my soul glory in the LORD;<br>

       the lowly will hear me and be glad.<br>

R. Taste and see the goodness of the Lord.<br>

The LORD has eyes for the just,<br>

       and ears for their cry.<br>

The LORD confronts the evildoers,<br>

       to destroy remembrance of them from the earth.<br>

R. Taste and see the goodness of the Lord.<br>

When the just cry out, the LORD hears them,<br>

       and from all their distress he rescues them.<br>

The LORD is close to the brokenhearted;<br>

       and those who are crushed in spirit he saves.<br>

R. Taste and see the goodness of the Lord.<br>

Many are the troubles of the just one,<br>

       but out of them all the LORD delivers him;<br>

he watches over all his bones;<br>

      not one of them shall be broken.<br>

R. Taste and see the goodness of the Lord.</p>
