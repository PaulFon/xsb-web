  <p>Brothers and sisters:<br>

What does Scripture say?<br>

            The word is near you,<br>

                        in your mouth and in your heart<br>

—that is, the word of faith that we preach—,<br>

for, if you confess with your mouth that Jesus is Lord<br>

and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead,<br>

you will be saved.<br>

For one believes with the heart and so is justified,<br>

and one confesses with the mouth and so is saved.<br>

For the Scripture says,<br>

            No one who believes in him will be put to shame.<br>

For there is no distinction between Jew and Greek;<br>

the same Lord is Lord of all,<br>

enriching all who call upon him.<br>

For “everyone who calls on the name of the Lord will be saved.”</p>
