  <p>A reading from the Book of the Prophet Isaiah:<br>

For Zion’s sake I will not be silent,<br>

        for Jerusalem’s sake I will not be quiet,<br>

    until her vindication shines forth like the dawn<br>

        and her victory like a burning torch.<br>

<br>

    Nations shall behold your vindication,<br>

        and all the kings your glory;<br>

    you shall be called by a new name<br>

        pronounced by the mouth of the LORD.<br>

    You shall be a glorious crown in the hand of the LORD,<br>

        a royal diadem held by your God.<br>

    No more shall people call you “Forsaken,”<br>

        or your land “Desolate,”<br>

    but you shall be called “My Delight,”<br>

        and your land “Espoused.”<br>

    For the LORD delights in you<br>

        and makes your land his spouse.<br>

    As a young man marries a virgin,<br>

        your Builder shall marry you;<br>

    and as a bridegroom rejoices in his bride<br>

        so shall your God rejoice in you.</p>
