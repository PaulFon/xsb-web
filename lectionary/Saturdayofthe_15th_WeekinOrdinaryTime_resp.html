<div class="poetry">
<p>R. (12b) <strong>Do not forget the poor, O Lord!</strong><br />
Why, O LORD, do you stand aloof?<br />
Why hide in times of distress?<br />
Proudly the wicked harass the afflicted,<br />
who are caught in the devices the wicked have contrived.<br />
R. <strong>Do not forget the poor, O Lord!</strong><br />
For the wicked man glories in his greed,<br />
and the covetous blasphemes, sets the LORD at nought.<br />
The wicked man boasts, “He will not avenge it”;<br />
“There is no God,” sums up his thoughts.<br />
R. <strong>Do not forget the poor, O Lord!</strong><br />
His mouth is full of cursing, guile and deceit;<br />
under his tongue are mischief and iniquity.<br />
He lurks in ambush near the villages;<br />
in hiding he murders the innocent;<br />
his eyes spy upon the unfortunate.<br />
R. <strong>Do not forget the poor, O Lord!</strong><br />
You do see, for you behold misery and sorrow,<br />
taking them in your hands.<br />
On you the unfortunate man depends;<br />
of the fatherless you are the helper.<br />
R. <strong>Do not forget the poor, O Lord!</strong></p>
