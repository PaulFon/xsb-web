  <p>A reading from the holy Gospel according to Mark. R. Glory to you, O Lord. <br>

In the course of his teaching Jesus said to the crowds,<br>

"Beware of the scribes, who like to go around in long robes<br>

and accept greetings in the marketplaces,<br>

seats of honor in synagogues, <br>

and places of honor at banquets.<br>

They devour the houses of widows and, as a pretext<br>

recite lengthy prayers. <br>

They will receive a very severe condemnation."<br>

<br>

He sat down opposite the treasury<br>

and observed how the crowd put money into the treasury. <br>

Many rich people put in large sums.<br>

A poor widow also came and put in two small coins worth a few cents. <br>

Calling his disciples to himself, he said to them,<br>

"Amen, I say to you, this poor widow put in more<br>

than all the other contributors to the treasury. <br>

For they have all contributed from their surplus wealth,<br>

but she, from her poverty, has contributed all she had,<br>

her whole livelihood."<br>
