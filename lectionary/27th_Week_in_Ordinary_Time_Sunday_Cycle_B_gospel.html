  <p>A reading from the holy Gospel according to Mark. <br>

R. Glory to you, O Lord. <br>

The Pharisees approached Jesus and asked,<br>

"Is it lawful for a husband to divorce his wife?" <br>

They were testing him.<br>

He said to them in reply, "What did Moses command you?" <br>

They replied,<br>

"Moses permitted a husband to write a bill of divorce<br>

and dismiss her."<br>

But Jesus told them,<br>

"Because of the hardness of your hearts<br>

he wrote you this commandment. <br>

But from the beginning of creation, God made them male and female. <br>

For this reason a man shall leave his father and mother<br>

and be joined to his wife,<br>

and the two shall become one flesh.<br>

So they are no longer two but one flesh. <br>

Therefore what God has joined together,<br>

no human being must separate." <br>

In the house the disciples again questioned Jesus about this. <br>

He said to them,<br>

"Whoever divorces his wife and marries another<br>

commits adultery against her;<br>

and if she divorces her husband and marries another,<br>

she commits adultery."<br>

<br>

And people were bringing children to him that he might touch them,<br>

but the disciples rebuked them.<br>

When Jesus saw this he became indignant and said to them,<br>

"Let the children come to me;<br>

do not prevent them, for the kingdom of God belongs to<br>

such as these. <br>

Amen, I say to you,<br>

whoever does not accept the kingdom of God like a child<br>

will not enter it."<br>

Then he embraced them and blessed them,<br>

placing his hands on them.<br>
