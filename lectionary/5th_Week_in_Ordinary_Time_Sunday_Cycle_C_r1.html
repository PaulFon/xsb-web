  <p>A reading from the Book of Isaiah: <br>

In the year King Uzziah died,<br>

I saw the Lord seated on a high and lofty throne,<br>

with the train of his garment filling the temple.<br>

Seraphim were stationed above.<br>

They cried one to the other,<br>

"Holy, holy, holy is the LORD of hosts!<br>

All the earth is filled with his glory!"<br>

At the sound of that cry, the frame of the door shook<br>

and the house was filled with smoke.<br>

Then I said, "Woe is me, I am doomed!<br>

For I am a man of unclean lips,<br>

living among a people of unclean lips;<br>

yet my eyes have seen the King, the LORD of hosts!"<br>

Then one of the seraphim flew to me,<br>

holding an ember that he had taken with tongs from the altar.<br>

He touched my mouth with it, and said,<br>

"See, now that this has touched your lips,<br>

your wickedness is removed, your sin purged."<br>

Then I heard the voice of the Lord saying,<br>

"Whom shall I send?  Who will go for us?"<br>

"Here I am," I said; "send me!"</p>
