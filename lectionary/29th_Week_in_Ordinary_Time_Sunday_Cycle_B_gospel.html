  <p>A reading from the holy Gospel according to Mark. R. Glory to you, O Lord.<br>

James and John, the sons of Zebedee, came to Jesus and said to him,<br>

"Teacher, we want you to do for us whatever we ask of you." <br>

He replied, "What do you wish me to do for you?" <br>

They answered him, "Grant that in your glory<br>

we may sit one at your right and the other at your left." <br>

Jesus said to them, "You do not know what you are asking. <br>

Can you drink the cup that I drink<br>

or be baptized with the baptism with which I am baptized?" <br>

They said to him, "We can." <br>

Jesus said to them, "The cup that I drink, you will drink,<br>

and with the baptism with which I am baptized, you will be baptized;<br>

but to sit at my right or at my left is not mine to give<br>

but is for those for whom it has been prepared." <br>

When the ten heard this, they became indignant at James and John. <br>

Jesus summoned them and said to them,<br>

"You know that those who are recognized as rulers over the Gentiles<br>

lord it over them,<br>

and their great ones make their authority over them felt. <br>

But it shall not be so among you.<br>

Rather, whoever wishes to be great among you will be your servant;<br>

whoever wishes to be first among you will be the slave of all. <br>

For the Son of Man did not come to be served<br>

but to serve and to give his life as a ransom for many."<br>

OR:<br>

Jesus summoned the twelve and said to them,<br>

"You know that those who are recognized as rulers over the Gentiles<br>

lord it over them,<br>

and their great ones make their authority over them felt. <br>

But it shall not be so among you. <br>

Rather, whoever wishes to be great among you will be your servant;<br>

whoever wishes to be first among you will be the slave of all. <br>

For the Son of Man did not come to be served<br>

but to serve and to give his life as a ransom for many."</p>
