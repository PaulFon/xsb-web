  <p>R. A light will shine on us this day: the Lord is born for us.<br>

The LORD is king; let the earth rejoice;<br>

   let the many isles be glad.<br>

The heavens proclaim his justice,<br>

   and all peoples see his glory.<br>

R. A light will shine on us this day: the Lord is born for us.<br>

Light dawns for the just;<br>

   and gladness, for the upright of heart.<br>

Be glad in the LORD, you just,<br>

   and give thanks to his holy name.<br>

R. A light will shine on us this day: the Lord is born for us.</p>
