      <body><h4>Gospel <a href="/bible/matthew/10:34">Mt 10:34-11:1</a></h4>
<div class="poetry">
<p>Jesus said to his Apostles:<br />
“Do not think that I have come to bring peace upon the earth.<br />
I have come to bring not peace but the sword.<br />
For I have come to set<br />
a man against his father,<br />
a daughter against her mother,<br />
and a daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law;<br />
and one’s enemies will be those of his household.</p>
<p>“Whoever loves father or mother more than me is not worthy of me,<br />
and whoever loves son or daughter more than me is not worthy of me;<br />
and whoever does not take up his cross<br />
and follow after me is not worthy of me.<br />
Whoever finds his life will lose it,<br />
and whoever loses his life for my sake will find it.</p>
<p>“Whoever receives you receives me,<br />
and whoever receives me receives the one who sent me.<br />
Whoever receives a prophet because he is a prophet<br />
will receive a prophet’s reward,<br />
and whoever receives a righteous man<br />
because he is righteous<br />
will receive a righteous man’s reward.<br />
And whoever gives only a cup of cold water<br />
to one of these little ones to drink<br />
because he is a disciple–<br />
amen, I say to you, he will surely not lose his reward.”</p>
<p>When Jesus finished giving these commands to his Twelve disciples,<br />
he went away from that place to teach and to preach in their towns.</p>
