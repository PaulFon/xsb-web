  <p>Let us pray.<br>

<br>

Graciously hear our supplications, O Lord,<br>

<br>

so that we, who believe that the Saviour of the human race <br>

<br>

is with you in your glory,<br>

<br>

may experience, as he promised,<br>

<br>

until the end of the world,<br>

<br>

his abiding presence among us.<br>

<br>

Who lives and reigns with you in the unity of the Holy Spirit, <br>

<br>

one God, for ever and ever.</p>
