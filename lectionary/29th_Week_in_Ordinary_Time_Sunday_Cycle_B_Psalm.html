  <p>R. Lord, let your mercy be on us, as we place our trust in you.<br>

Upright is the word of the LORD,<br>

    and all his works are trustworthy.<br>

He loves justice and right;<br>

    of the kindness of the LORD the earth is full.<br>

R. Lord, let your mercy be on us, as we place our trust in you.<br>

See, the eyes of the LORD are upon those who fear him,<br>

    upon those who hope for his kindness,<br>

To deliver them from death<br>

    and preserve them in spite of famine.<br>

R. Lord, let your mercy be on us, as we place our trust in you.<br>

Our soul waits for the LORD,<br>

    who is our help and our shield.<br>

May your kindness, O LORD, be upon us<br>

    who have put our hope in you.<br>

R. Lord, let your mercy be on us, as we place our trust in you.</p>
