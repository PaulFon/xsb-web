  <p>R. For ever I will sing the goodness of the Lord.<br>

I have made a covenant with my chosen one,<br>

   I have sworn to David my servant:<br>

Forever will I confirm your posterity<br>

   and establish your throne for all generations.<br>

R. For ever I will sing the goodness of the Lord.<br>

Blessed the people who know the joyful shout;<br>

   in the light of your countenance, O LORD, they walk.<br>

At your name they rejoice all the day,<br>

   and through your justice they are exalted.<br>

R. For ever I will sing the goodness of the Lord.<br>

He shall say of me, “You are my father,<br>

   my God, the rock, my savior.”<br>

Forever I will maintain my kindness toward him,<br>

   and my covenant with him stands firm.<br>

R. For ever I will sing the goodness of the Lord.</p>
