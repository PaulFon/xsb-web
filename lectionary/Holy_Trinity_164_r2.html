<div class="poetry">
<p>Brothers and sisters, rejoice.
Mend your ways, encourage one another,
agree with one another, live in peace,
and the God of love and peace will be with you.
Greet one another with a holy kiss.
All the holy ones greet you.</p>
<p>The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ
and the love of God and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit be with all of you.</p>
