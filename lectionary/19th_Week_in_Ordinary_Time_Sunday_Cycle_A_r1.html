  <p>1 Kgs.19:9a, 11-13a<br>
  A reading from the book of Kings: </p>

  <p>At the mountain of God, Horeb, <br class="sline">
  Elijah came to a cave where he took shelter.  <br class="sline">
  Then the Lord said to him, <br class="sline">
  "Go outside and stand on the mountain before the Lord; <br class="sline">
  the Lord will be passing by."  <br class="sline">
  A strong and heavy wind was rending the mountains <br class="sline">
  and crushing rocks before the Lord <br class="sline">
  but the Lord was not in the wind.  <br class="sline">
  After the wind there was an earthquake <br class="sline">
  but the Lord was not in the earthquake.  <br class="sline">
  After the earthquake there was fire <br class="sline">
  but the Lord was not in the fire. <br class="sline">
  After the fire there was a tiny whispering sound. <br class="sline">
  When he heard this, <br class="sline">
  Elijah hid his face in his cloak <br class="sline">
  and went and stood at the entrance of the cave.</p>
  <p>The word of the Lord. R. Thanks be to God.</p>
