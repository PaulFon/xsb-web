  <p>A reading from the book of Revelation: I, John, saw another angel come up from the East,<br>

holding the seal of the living God.<br>

He cried out in a loud voice to the four angels<br>

who were given power to damage the land and the sea,<br>

“Do not damage the land or the sea or the trees<br>

until we put the seal on the foreheads of the servants of our God.”<br>

I heard the number of those who had been marked with the seal,<br>

one hundred and forty-four thousand marked<br>

from every tribe of the children of Israel.<br>

<br>

After this I had a vision of a great multitude,<br>

which no one could count,<br>

from every nation, race, people, and tongue.<br>

They stood before the throne and before the Lamb,<br>

wearing white robes and holding palm branches in their hands.<br>

They cried out in a loud voice:<br>

<br>

    “Salvation comes from our God, who is seated on the throne,<br>

    and from the Lamb.”<br>

<br>

All the angels stood around the throne<br>

and around the elders and the four living creatures.<br>

They prostrated themselves before the throne,<br>

worshiped God, and exclaimed:<br>

<br>

    “Amen.  Blessing and glory, wisdom and thanksgiving,<br>

        honor, power, and might<br>

        be to our God forever and ever.  Amen.”<br>

<br>

Then one of the elders spoke up and said to me,<br>

“Who are these wearing white robes, and where did they come from?”<br>

I said to him, “My lord, you are the one who knows.”<br>

He said to me,<br>

    “These are the ones who have survived the time of great distress;<br>

    they have washed their robes<br>

    and made them white in the Blood of the Lamb.”</p>
