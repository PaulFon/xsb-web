May God, who by the Resurrection of his Only Begotten Son was pleased to confer on you the gift of redemption and of adoption, give you gladness by his blessing. R. Amen.
May he, by whose redeeming work you have received the gift of everlasting freedom, make you heirs to an eternal inheritance. R. Amen.
And may you, who have already risen with Christ in Baptism through faith, by living in a right manner on this earth, be united with him in the homeland of heaven. R. Amen.
And may the blessing of almighty God, the Father, and the Son, and the Holy Spirit, come down on you and remain with you for ever. R. Amen.
