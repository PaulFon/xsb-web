  <p>A reading from the Book of Jeremiah: <br>

Thus says the LORD:<br>

Cursed is the one who trusts in human beings,<br>

who seeks his strength in flesh,<br>

whose heart turns away from the LORD.<br>

He is like a barren bush in the desert<br>

that enjoys no change of season,<br>

but stands in a lava waste,<br>

a salt and empty earth.<br>

Blessed is the one who trusts in the LORD,<br>

whose hope is the LORD.<br>

He is like a tree planted beside the waters<br>

that stretches out its roots to the stream:<br>

it fears not the heat when it comes;<br>

its leaves stay green;<br>

in the year of drought it shows no distress,<br>

but still bears fruit.</p>
