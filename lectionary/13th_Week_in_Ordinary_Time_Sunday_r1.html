<div class="poetry">
<p>One day Elisha came to Shunem,<br />
where there was a woman of influence, who urged him to dine with her.<br />
Afterward, whenever he passed by, he used to stop there to dine.<br />
So she said to her husband, “I know that Elisha is a holy man of God.<br />
Since he visits us often, let us arrange a little room on the roof<br />
and furnish it for him with a bed, table, chair, and lamp,<br />
so that when he comes to us he can stay there.”<br />
Sometime later Elisha arrived and stayed in the room overnight.</p>
<p>Later Elisha asked, “Can something be done for her?”<br />
His servant Gehazi answered, “Yes!<br />
She has no son, and her husband is getting on in years.”<br />
Elisha said, “Call her.”<br />
When the woman had been called and stood at the door,<br />
Elisha promised, “This time next year<br />
you will be fondling a baby son.”</p>
