  <p>A reading from the holy Gospel according to Luke. R. Glory to you, O Lord. <br>

The people were filled with expectation,<br>

and all were asking in their hearts<br>

whether John might be the Christ.<br>

John answered them all, saying, <br>

“I am baptizing you with water,<br>

but one mightier than I is coming.<br>

I am not worthy to loosen the thongs of his sandals.<br>

He will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and fire.”<br>

<br>

After all the people had been baptized <br>

and Jesus also had been baptized and was praying, <br>

heaven was opened and the Holy Spirit descended upon him<br>

in bodily form like a dove. <br>

And a voice came from heaven, <br>

“You are my beloved Son;<br>

with you I am well pleased.”</p>
