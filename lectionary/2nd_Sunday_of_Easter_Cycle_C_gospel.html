  <p>On the evening of that first day of the week,<br>

when the doors were locked, where the disciples were,<br>

for fear of the Jews,<br>

Jesus came and stood in their midst<br>

and said to them, “Peace be with you.”<br>

When he had said this, he showed them his hands and his side.<br>

The disciples rejoiced when they saw the Lord.<br>

Jesus said to them again, “Peace be with you.<br>

As the Father has sent me, so I send you.”<br>

And when he had said this, he breathed on them and said to them,<br>

“Receive the Holy Spirit.<br>

Whose sins you forgive are forgiven them,<br>

and whose sins you retain are retained.”<br>

<br>

Thomas, called Didymus, one of the Twelve,<br>

was not with them when Jesus came.<br>

So the other disciples said to him, “We have seen the Lord.”<br>

But he said to them,<br>

“Unless I see the mark of the nails in his hands<br>

and put my finger into the nailmarks<br>

and put my hand into his side, I will not believe.”<br>

<br>

Now a week later his disciples were again inside<br>

and Thomas was with them.<br>

Jesus came, although the doors were locked,<br>

and stood in their midst and said, “Peace be with you.”<br>

Then he said to Thomas, “Put your finger here and see my hands,<br>

and bring your hand and put it into my side,<br>

and do not be unbelieving, but believe.”<br>

Thomas answered and said to him, “My Lord and my God!”<br>

Jesus said to him, “Have you come to believe because you have seen me?<br>

Blessed are those who have not seen and have believed.”<br>

<br>

Now Jesus did many other signs in the presence of his disciples<br>

that are not written in this book.<br>

But these are written that you may come to believe<br>

that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God,<br>

and that through this belief you may have life in his name.</p>
