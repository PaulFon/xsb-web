  <p>A reading from the Book of Deuteronomy: <br>

Moses spoke to the people, saying:<br>

"Fear the LORD, your God,<br>

and keep, throughout the days of your lives,<br>

all his statutes and commandments which I enjoin on you,<br>

and thus have long life.<br>

Hear then, Israel, and be careful to observe them,<br>

that you may grow and prosper the more,<br>

in keeping with the promise of the LORD, the God of your fathers,<br>

to give you a land flowing with milk and honey.<br>

<br>

"Hear, O Israel! The LORD is our God, the LORD alone! <br>

Therefore, you shall love the LORD, your God,<br>

with all your heart,<br>

and with all your soul,<br>

and with all your strength. <br>

Take to heart these words which I enjoin on you today."</p>
