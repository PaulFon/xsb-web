  <p>A reading from the Gospel of Luke<br>

Some people told Jesus about the Galileans<br>

whose blood Pilate had mingled with the blood of their sacrifices.<br>

Jesus said to them in reply,<br>

“Do you think that because these Galileans suffered in this way<br>

they were greater sinners than all other Galileans?<br>

By no means!<br>

But I tell you, if you do not repent,<br>

you will all perish as they did!<br>

Or those eighteen people who were killed<br>

when the tower at Siloam fell on them—<br>

do you think they were more guilty<br>

than everyone else who lived in Jerusalem?<br>

By no means!<br>

But I tell you, if you do not repent,<br>

you will all perish as they did!”<br>

And he told them this parable:<br>

“There once was a person who had a fig tree planted in his orchard,<br>

and when he came in search of fruit on it but found none,<br>

he said to the gardener,<br>

‘For three years now I have come in search of fruit on this fig tree<br>

but have found none.<br>

So cut it down.<br>

Why should it exhaust the soil?’<br>

He said to him in reply,<br>

‘Sir, leave it for this year also,<br>

and I shall cultivate the ground around it and fertilize it;<br>

it may bear fruit in the future.<br>

If not you can cut it down.’”</p>
