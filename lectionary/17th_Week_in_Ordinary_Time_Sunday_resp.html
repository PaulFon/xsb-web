<div class="poetry">
<p>R. (97a) <strong>Lord, I love your commands.</strong><br />
I have said, O LORD, that my part<br />
is to keep your words.<br />
The law of your mouth is to me more precious<br />
than thousands of gold and silver pieces.<br />
R. <strong>Lord, I love your commands.</strong><br />
Let your kindness comfort me<br />
according to your promise to your servants.<br />
Let your compassion come to me that I may live,<br />
for your law is my delight.<br />
R. <strong>Lord, I love your commands.</strong><br />
For I love your command<br />
more than gold, however fine.<br />
For in all your precepts I go forward;<br />
every false way I hate.<br />
R. <strong>Lord, I love your commands.</strong><br />
Wonderful are your decrees;<br />
therefore I observe them.<br />
The revelation of your words sheds light,<br />
giving understanding to the simple.<br />
R. <strong>Lord, I love your commands.</strong></p>
