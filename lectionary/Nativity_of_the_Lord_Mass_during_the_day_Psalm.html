  <p>R. All the ends of the earth have seen the saving power of God.<br>

Sing to the LORD a new song,<br>

   for he has done wondrous deeds;<br>

his right hand has won victory for him,<br>

   his holy arm.<br>

R. All the ends of the earth have seen the saving power of God.<br>

The LORD has made his salvation known:<br>

   in the sight of the nations he has revealed his justice.<br>

He has remembered his kindness and his faithfulness<br>

   toward the house of Israel.<br>

R. All the ends of the earth have seen the saving power of God.<br>

All the ends of the earth have seen<br>

   the salvation by our God.<br>

Sing joyfully to the LORD, all you lands;<br>

   break into song; sing praise.<br>

R. All the ends of the earth have seen the saving power of God.<br>

Sing praise to the LORD with the harp,<br>

   with the harp and melodious song.<br>

With trumpets and the sound of the horn<br>

   sing joyfully before the King, the LORD.<br>

R. All the ends of the earth have seen the saving power of God.</p>
