  <p>A reading from the second book of Kings: A man came from Baal-shalishah bringing to Elisha, the man of God, twenty barley loaves made from the first fruits, and fresh grain in the ear. Elisha said, "Give it to the people to eat." But his servant objected, "How can I set this before a hundred people?" Elisha insisted, "Give it to the people to eat. For thus says the Lord, `They shall eat and there shall be some left over.`" And when they had eaten, there was some left over, as the Lord  had said.</p>
