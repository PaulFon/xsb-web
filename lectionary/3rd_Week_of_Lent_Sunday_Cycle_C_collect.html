  <p>O God, author of every mercy and of all goodness,<br>

who in fasting, prayer and almsgiving<br>

have shown us a remedy for sin,<br>

look graciously on this confession of our lowliness,<br>

that we, who are bowed down by our conscience,<br>

may always be lifted up by your mercy.<br>

<br>

Through our Lord Jesus Christ, your Son,<br>

who lives and reigns with you in the unity of the Holy Spirit,<br>

one God, for ever and ever.</p>
