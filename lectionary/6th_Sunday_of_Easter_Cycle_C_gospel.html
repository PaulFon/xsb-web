  <p>A reading from the Gospel according to John<br>

Jesus said to his disciples:<br>

“Whoever loves me will keep my word,<br>

and my Father will love him,<br>

and we will come to him and make our dwelling with him.<br>

Whoever does not love me does not keep my words;<br>

yet the word you hear is not mine<br>

but that of the Father who sent me.<br>

<br>

“I have told you this while I am with you.<br>

The Advocate, the Holy Spirit,<br>

whom the Father will send in my name,<br>

will teach you everything<br>

and remind you of all that I told you.<br>

Peace I leave with you; my peace I give to you.<br>

Not as the world gives do I give it to you.<br>

Do not let your hearts be troubled or afraid.<br>

You heard me tell you,<br>

‘I am going away and I will come back to you.’<br>

If you loved me,<br>

you would rejoice that I am going to the Father;<br>

for the Father is greater than I.<br>

And now I have told you this before it happens,<br>

so that when it happens you may believe.”</p>
