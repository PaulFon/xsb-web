  <p>A reading from the book of the Prophet Isaiah: </p>
  Thus says the Lord: <br class="sline">
  Observe what is right, do what is just; <br class="sline">
  for my salvation is about to come, <br class="sline">
  my justice, about to be revealed. </p>
  <p>The foreigners who join themselves to the Lord, <br class="sline">
    ministering to him, <br class="sline">
    loving the name of the Lord, <br class="sline">
    and becoming his servants—<br class="sline">
    all who keep the sabbath free from profanation <br class="sline">
    and hold to my covenant, <br class="sline">
    them I will bring to my holy mountain <br class="sline">
    and make joyful in my house of prayer; <br class="sline">
    their burnt offerings and sacrifices <br class="sline">
    will be acceptable on my altar, <br class="sline">
    r my house shall be called <br class="sline">
    a house of prayer for all peoples. </p>
    The word of the Lord. <br class="sline">
    R. Thanks be to God.</p>
