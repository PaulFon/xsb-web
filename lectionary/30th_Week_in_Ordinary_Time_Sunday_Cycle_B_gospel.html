  <p>A reading from the holy Gospel according to Mark. R. Glory to you, O Lord. <br>

As Jesus was leaving Jericho with his disciples and a sizable crowd,<br>

Bartimaeus, a blind man, the son of Timaeus,<br>

sat by the roadside begging.<br>

On hearing that it was Jesus of Nazareth,<br>

he began to cry out and say,<br>

"Jesus, son of David, have pity on me."<br>

And many rebuked him, telling him to be silent. <br>

But he kept calling out all the more,<br>

"Son of David, have pity on me."<br>

Jesus stopped and said, "Call him."<br>

So they called the blind man, saying to him,<br>

"Take courage; get up, Jesus is calling you."<br>

He threw aside his cloak, sprang up, and came to Jesus. <br>

Jesus said to him in reply, "What do you want me to do for you?" <br>

The blind man replied to him, "Master, I want to see." <br>

Jesus told him, "Go your way; your faith has saved you." <br>

Immediately he received his sight<br>

and followed him on the way.</p>
