your children like olive plants<br>

   around your table.<br>

R. (cf. 5a)  Blessed are they who dwell in your house, O Lord.<br>

How lovely is your dwelling place, O LORD of hosts!<br>

    My soul yearns and pines for the courts of the LORD.<br>

My heart and my flesh cry out for the living God.<br>

R. Blessed are they who dwell in your house, O Lord.<br>

Happy they who dwell in your house!<br>

    Continually they praise you.<br>

Happy the men whose strength you are!<br>

    Their hearts are set upon the pilgrimage.<br>

R. Blessed are they who dwell in your house, O Lord.<br>

O LORD of hosts, hear our prayer;<br>

    hearken, O God of Jacob!<br>

O God, behold our shield,<br>

    and look upon the face of your anointed.<br>

R. Blessed are they who dwell in your house, O Lord.</p>
