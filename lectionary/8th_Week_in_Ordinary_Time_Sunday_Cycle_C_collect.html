  <p>Let us pray. <br>

Grant us, O Lord, we pray, <br>

that the course of our world <br>

may be directed by your peaceful rule <br>

and that your Church may rejoice, <br>

untroubled in her devotion. <br>

Through our Lord Jesus Christ, your Son, <br>

who lives and reigns with you in the unity of the Holy Spirit, <br>

God, for ever and ever. R. Amen.</p>
