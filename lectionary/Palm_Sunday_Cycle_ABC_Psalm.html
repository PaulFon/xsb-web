  <p>R My God, my God, why have you abandoned me?<br>

All who see me scoff at me;<br>

they mock me with parted lips, they wag their heads:<br>

“He relied on the LORD; let him deliver him,<br>

let him rescue him, if he loves him.”<br>

R My God, my God, why have you abandoned me?<br>

Indeed, many dogs surround me,<br>

a pack of evildoers closes in upon me;<br>

They have pierced my hands and my feet;<br>

I can count all my bones.<br>

R My God, my God, why have you abandoned me?<br>

They divide my garments among them,<br>

and for my vesture they cast lots.<br>

But you, O LORD, be not far from me;<br>

O my help, hasten to aid me.<br>

R My God, my God, why have you abandoned me?<br>

I will proclaim your name to my brethren;<br>

in the midst of the assembly I will praise you:<br>

“You who fear the LORD, praise him;<br>

all you descendants of Jacob, give glory to him;<br>

revere him, all you descendants of Israel!”<br>

R My God, my God, why have you abandoned me?</p>
