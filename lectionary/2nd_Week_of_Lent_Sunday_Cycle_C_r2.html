  <p>A reading from the Letter of St. Paul to the Philippians<br>

Join with others in being imitators of me, brothers and sisters,<br>

and observe those who thus conduct themselves<br>

according to the model you have in us.<br>

For many, as I have often told you<br>

and now tell you even in tears,<br>

conduct themselves as enemies of the cross of Christ.<br>

Their end is destruction.<br>

Their God is their stomach;<br>

their glory is in their “shame.”<br>

Their minds are occupied with earthly things.<br>

But our citizenship is in heaven,<br>

and from it we also await a savior, the Lord Jesus Christ.<br>

He will change our lowly body<br>

to conform with his glorified body<br>

by the power that enables him also<br>

to bring all things into subjection to himself.<br>

<br>

Therefore, my brothers and sisters,<br>

whom I love and long for, my joy and crown,<br>

in this way stand firm in the Lord.<br>

<br>

or:<br>

<br>

Phil 3:20—4:1<br>

<br>

Brothers and sisters:<br>

Our citizenship is in heaven,<br>

and from it we also await a savior, the Lord Jesus Christ.<br>

He will change our lowly body<br>

to conform with his glorified body<br>

by the power that enables him also<br>

to bring all things into subjection to himself.<br>

<br>

Therefore, my brothers and sisters,<br>

whom I love and long for, my joy and crown,<br>

in this way stand firm in the Lord, beloved.</p>
