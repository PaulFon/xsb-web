  <p>R. Let My Tongue Be Silenced, If I Ever Forget You! <br>
By the streams of Babylon we sat and wept <br>
when we remembered Zion. <br>
On the aspens of that land we hung up our harps. <br>
R. Let my tongue be silenced, if I ever forget you! <br>
For there our captors asked of us the lyrics of our songs, <br>
and our despoilers urged us to be joyous: "Sing for us the songs of Zion!" <br>
<br>
R. Let my tongue be silenced, if I ever forget you! <br>
How could we sing a song of the Lord in a foreign land? <br>
If I forget you, Jerusalem, may my right hand be forgotten! <br>
R. Let my tongue be silenced, if I ever forget you! <br>
<br>
May my tongue cleave to my palate if I remember you not, <br>
If I place not Jerusalem ahead of my joy. <br>
R. Let my tongue be silenced, if I ever forget you!</p>
