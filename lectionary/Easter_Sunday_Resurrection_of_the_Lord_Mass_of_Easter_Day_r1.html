  <p>Peter proceeded to speak and said:<br>
“You know what has happened all over Judea, <br>
beginning in Galilee after the baptism<br>
that John preached, <br>
how God anointed Jesus of Nazareth<br>
with the Holy Spirit and power.<br>
He went about doing good<br>
and healing all those oppressed by the devil, <br>
for God was with him.<br>
We are witnesses of all that he did<br>
both in the country of the Jews and in Jerusalem.<br>
They put him to death by hanging him on a tree.<br>
This man God raised on the third day and granted that he be visible,<br>
not to all the people, but to us,<br>
the witnesses chosen by God in advance,<br>
who ate and drank with him after he rose from the dead.<br>
He commissioned us to preach to the people<br>
and testify that he is the one appointed by God<br>
as judge of the living and the dead.<br>
To him all the prophets bear witness,<br>
that everyone who believes in him<br>
will receive forgiveness of sins through his name.”</p>
