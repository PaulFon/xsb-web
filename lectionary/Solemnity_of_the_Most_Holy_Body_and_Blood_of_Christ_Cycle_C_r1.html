  <p>A reading from the book of Genesis<br>

In those days, Melchizedek, king of Salem, brought out bread and wine,<br>

and being a priest of God Most High,<br>

he blessed Abram with these words:<br>

"Blessed be Abram by God Most High,<br>

the creator of heaven and earth;<br>

and blessed be God Most High,<br>

who delivered your foes into your hand."<br>

Then Abram gave him a tenth of everything.</p>
