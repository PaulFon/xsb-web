  <p>A reading from the Acts of the Apostles:<br>

When Paul reached Antioch in Pisidia and entered the synagogue,<br>

he stood up, motioned with his hand, and said, <br>

“Fellow Israelites and you others who are God-fearing, listen.<br>

The God of this people Israel chose our ancestors <br>

and exalted the people during their sojourn in the<br>

land of Egypt.<br>

With uplifted arm he led them out of it.<br>

Then he removed Saul and raised up David as king;<br>

of him he testified,<br>

‘I have found David, son of Jesse, a man after my own heart;<br>

he will carry out my every wish.’<br>

From this man’s descendants God, according to his promise, <br>

has brought to Israel a savior, Jesus.<br>

John heralded his coming by proclaiming a baptism of repentance <br>

to all the people of Israel; <br>

and as John was completing his course, he would say, <br>

‘What do you suppose that I am?  I am not he.<br>

Behold, one is coming after me; <br>

I am not worthy to unfasten the sandals of his feet.’”</p>
