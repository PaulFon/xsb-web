<p class="rubric">1. When the people are gathered, the Priest approaches the altar with the ministers while the Entrance Chant is sung. </p>

<p class="rubric">When he has arrived at the altar, after making a profound bow with the ministers, the Priest venerates the altar with a kiss and, if appropriate, incenses the cross and the altar. Then, with the ministers, he goes to the chair. </p>

<p class="rubric">When the Entrance Chant is concluded, the Priest and the faithful, standing, sign themselves with the Sign of the Cross, while the Priest, facing the people, says: </p>

<p class="calibre6">In the name of the Father, and of the Son, <br class="sline">
and of the Holy Spirit. </p>

<p class="rubric">The people reply: </p>

<p class="response">R. Amen.</p>

<p class="rubric">2. Then the Priest, extending his hands, greets the people, saying: </p>

<p class="calibre6">The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, <br class="sline">
and the love of God, <br class="sline">
and the communion of the Holy Spirit <br class="sline">
be with you all. </p>

<p class="rubric">or: </p>

<p class="calibre6">Grace to you and peace from God our Father <br class="sline">
and the Lord Jesus Christ. </p>

<p class="rubric">or: </p>

<p class="calibre6">The Lord be with you. </p>

<p class="rubric">The people reply: </p>

<p class="response">And with your spirit. </p>

<p class="rubric">In this first greeting a Bishop, instead of “The Lord be with you”, says: </p>
<!--  Taking this line because it will not be used by parish. Will add logic later to handle the option.
<p class="calibre6">Peace be with you. </p>
<p>R. And with your spirit.</p> -->

<p class="rubric">3. The Priest, or a Deacon, or another minister, may very briefly introduce the faithful to the Mass of the day. </p>
