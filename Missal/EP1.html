<p class="rubric">84. The Priest, with hands extended, says: </p>

<p class="calibre6">To you, therefore, most merciful Father, <br class="sline">
	we make humble prayer and petition <br class="sline">
	through Jesus Christ, your Son, our Lord: </p>

<p class="rubric">He joins his hands and says </p>

	<p class="calibre6">that you accept<br class="sline"></p>

<p class="rubric">He makes the Sign of the Cross once over the bread and chalice together, saying: </p>

<p class="calibre6">and bless <span class="red1">+</span> these gifts, these offerings, <br class="sline">
	these holy and unblemished sacrifices, <br class="sline"></p>
<p class="rubric">With hands extended, he continues: </p>

<p class="calibre6">which we offer you firstly <br class="sline">
	for your holyncatholic Church. <br class="sline"> 
	Be pleased to grant her peace, <br class="sline">
	to guard, unite and govern her <br class="sline">
	throughout the whole world, <br class="sline"> 
	together with your servant <span class="red1">Francis</span> our Pope <br class="sline">
	and Wilton our Bishop, <br class="sline"> 
	and all those who, holding to the truth, <br class="sline"> 
	hand on the catholic and apostolic faith. </p>

<p class="rubric">85. Commemoration of the Living. </p>

<p class="calibre6">Remember, Lord, your servants <span class="red1">N.</span> and <span class="red1">N.</span></p>

<p class="rubric">The Priest joins his hands and prays briefly for those for whom he intends to pray. Then, with hands extended, he continues: </p>

<p class="calibre6">and all gathered here, <br class="sline"> 
	whose faith and devotion are known to you. <br class="sline">
	For them, we offer you this sacrifice of praise <br class="sline"> 
	or they offer it for themselves <br class="sline"> 
	and all who are dear to them: <br class="sline"> 
	for the redemption of their souls, <br class="sline"> 
	in hope of health and well-being, <br class="sline"> 
	and paying their homage to you, <br class="sline"> 
	the eternal God, living and true. </p>

<p class="rubric">86. Within the Action.</p>

<p class="calibre6">In communion with those whose memory we venerate, <br class="sline"> 
	especially the glorious ever-Virgin Mary, <br class="sline"> 
	Mother of our God and Lord, Jesus Christ, <br class="sline"> 
	and blessed Joseph, her Spouse, <br class="sline"> 
	your blessed Apostles and Martyrs, <br class="sline"> 
	Peter and Paul, Andrew, </p>

<p class="calibre6">
<span class="red1">(</span>James, John, <br class="sline"> 
	Thomas, James, Philip, <br class="sline"> 
	Bartholomew, Matthew, <br class="sline"> 
	Simon and Jude; <br class="sline"> 
	Linus, Cletus, Clement, Sixtus, <br class="sline"> 
	Cornelius, Cyprian, <br class="sline"> 
	Lawrence, Chrysogonus, <br class="sline"> 
	John and Paul, <br class="sline"> 
	Cosmas and Damian<span class="red1">)
</span></p>

<p class="calibre6">and all your Saints; <br class="sline"> 
	we ask that through their merits and prayers, <br class="sline"> 
	in all things we may be defended <br class="sline"> 
	by your protecting help. </p>

<p class="quietly"><span class="red1">(</span>Through Christ our Lord. Amen.<span class="red1">)</span> </p>

<p class="rubric">87. With hands extended, the Priest continues: </p>

<p class="calibre6">Therefore, Lord, we pray: <br class="sline"> 
	graciously accept this oblation of our service, <br class="sline"> 
	that of your whole family; <br class="sline"> 
	order our days in your peace, <br class="sline"> 
	and command that we be delivered from eternal damnation <br class="sline"> 
	and counted among the flock of those you have chosen. </p>

<p class="rubric">He joins his hands. </p>

<p class="quietly"><span class="red1">(</span>Through Christ our Lord. Amen.<span class="red1">)</span> </p>

<p class="rubric">88. Holding his hands extended over the offerings, he says: </p>

<p class="calibre6">Be pleased, O God, we pray, <br class="sline"> 
	to bless, acknowledge, <br class="sline"> 
	and approve this offering in every respect; <br class="sline"> 
	make it spiritual and acceptable, <br class="sline"> 
	so that it may become for us <br class="sline"> 
	the Body and Blood of your most beloved Son, <br class="sline"> 
	our Lord Jesus Christ. </p>

<p class="rubric">He joins his hands. </p>

<p class="rubric">89. In the formulas that follow, the words of the Lord should be pronounced clearly and distinctly, as the
nature of these words requires. </p>

<p class="calibre6">On the day before he was to suffer, </p>

<p class="rubric">He takes the bread and, holding it slightly raised above the altar, continues: </p>

<p class="calibre6">he took bread in his holy and venerable hands, </p>

<p class="rubric">He raises his eyes. </p>

<p class="calibre6">and with eyes raised to heaven to you, <br class="sline"> 
	O God, his almighty Father, <br class="sline"> 
	giving you thanks, he said the blessing, <br class="sline"> 
	broke the bread and gave it to his disciples, saying: </p>

<p class="rubric">He bows slightly. </p>

<p class="calibre6">Take this, all of you, and eat of it, <br class="sline"> 
	for this is my body, <br class="sline"> 
	which will be given up for you. </p>

<p class="rubric">He shows the consecrated host to the people, places it again on the paten, and genuflects in adoration. </p>

<p class="rubric">90. After this, the Priest continues: </p>

<p class="calibre6">In a similar way, when supper was ended, </p>

<p class="rubric">He takes the chalice and, holding it slightly raised above the altar, continues: </p>

<p class="calibre6">he took this precious chalice <br class="sline"> 
	in his holy and venerable hands, <br class="sline"> 
	and once more giving you thanks, he said the blessing <br class="sline"> 
	and gave the chalice to his disciples, saying: </p>

<p class="rubric">He bows slightly. </p>

<p class="calibre6"> Take this, all of you, and drink from it, <br class="sline"> 
	for this is the chalice of my blood, <br class="sline"> 
	the blood of the new and eternal covenant, <br class="sline"> 
	which will be poured out for you and for many <br class="sline"> 
	for the forgiveness of sins. <br class="sline"> 
	Do this in memory of me.</p>

<p class="rubric">He shows the chalice to the people, places it on the corporal, and genuflects in adoration. </p>

<p class="rubric">91. Then he says: </p>

<p class="calibre6">The mystery of faith. </p>

<p class="rubric">And the people continue, acclaiming: </p>

<p class="response">We proclaim your Death, O Lord, <br class="sline"> 
	and profess your Resurrection <br class="sline"> 
	until you come again. </p>

<p class="rubric">or: </p>

<p class="response">When we eat this Bread and drink this Cup, <br class="sline"> 
	we proclaim your Death, O Lord, <br class="sline"> 
	until you come again. </p>

<p class="rubric">or: </p>

<p class="response">Save us, Saviour of the world, <br class="sline"> 
	for by your Cross and Resurrection you have set us free. </p>

<p class="rubric">92. Then the Priest, with hands extended, says: </p>

<p class="calibre6">Therefore, O Lord, <br class="sline"> 
	as we celebrate the memorial of the blessed Passion, <br class="sline"> 
	the Resurrection from the dead, <br class="sline"> 
	and the glorious Ascension into heaven <br class="sline"> 
	of Christ, your Son, our Lord, <br class="sline"> 
	we, your servants and your holy people, <br class="sline"> 
	offer to your glorious majesty <br class="sline"> 
	from the gifts that you have given us, <br class="sline"> 
	this pure victim, <br class="sline"> 
	this holy victim, <br class="sline"> 
	this spotless victim, <br class="sline"> 
	the holy Bread of eternal life <br class="sline"> 
	and the Chalice of everlasting salvation. </p>

<p class="rubric">93. </p>

<p class="calibre6">Be pleased to look upon these offerings <br class="sline">  
	with a serene and kindly countenance, <br class="sline">  
	and to accept them, <br class="sline">  
	as once you were pleased to accept <br class="sline">  
	the gifts of your servant Abel the just, <br class="sline">  
	the sacrifice of Abraham, our father in faith, <br class="sline">  
	and the offering of your high priest Melchizedek, <br class="sline">  
	a holy sacrifice, a spotless victim. </p>

<p class="rubric">94. Bowing, with hands joined, he continues: </p>

<p class="calibre6">In humble prayer we ask you, almighty God: <br class="sline"> 
	command that these gifts be borne <br class="sline">  
	by the hands of your holy Angel <br class="sline">  
	to your altar on high <br class="sline">  
	in the sight of your divine majesty, <br class="sline">  
	so that all of us, who through this participation at the altar <br class="sline"> 
	receive the most holy Body and Blood of your Son, </p>

<p class="rubric">He stands upright again and signs himself with the Sign of the Cross, saying: </p>

<p class="calibre6">may be filled with every grace and heavenly blessing. </p>

<p class="rubric">He joins his hands. </p>

<p class="quietly"><span class="red1">(</span>Through Christ our Lord. Amen.<span class="red1">)</span> </p>

<p class="rubric">95. Commemoration of the Dead </p>

<p class="rubric">With hands extended, the Priest says: </p>

<p class="calibre6">Remember also, Lord, your servants <span class="red1">N.</span> and <span class="red1">N.</span>,<br class="sline"> 
	who have gone before us with the sign of faith <br class="sline">  
	and rest in the sleep of peace. </p>

<p class="rubric">He joins his hands and prays briefly for those who have died and for whom he intends to pray. </p>

<p class="rubric">Then, with hands extended, he continues: </p>

<p class="calibre6">Grant them, O Lord, we pray, <br class="sline">  
	and all who sleep in Christ, <br class="sline"> 
	a place of refreshment, light and peace. </p>

<p class="rubric">He joins his hands. </p>

<p class="quietly"><span class="red1">(</span>Through Christ our Lord. Amen.<span class="red1">)</span> </p>

<p class="rubric">96. He strikes his breast with his right hand, saying: </p>

<p class="calibre6">To us, also, your servants, who, though sinners, </p>

<p class="rubric">And, with hands extended, he continues: </p>

<p class="calibre6">hope in your abundant mercies, <br class="sline"> 
	graciously grant some share <br class="sline">  
	and fellowship with your holy Apostles and Martyrs: <br class="sline"> 
	with John the Baptist, Stephen, <br class="sline">  
	Matthias, Barnabas, </p>

<p class="calibre6"><span class="red1">(</span>Ignatius, Alexander, <br class="sline"> 
	Marcellinus, Peter, <br class="sline">  
	Felicity, Perpetua, <br class="sline">  
	Agatha, Lucy, <br class="sline">  
	Agnes, Cecilia, Anastasia<span class="red1">)</span> </p>

<p class="calibre6">and all your Saints; <br class="sline">  
	admit us, we beseech you, <br class="sline">  
	into their company, <br class="sline">  
	not weighing our merits, <br class="sline">  
	but granting us your pardon, </p>

<p class="rubric">He joins his hands. </p>

<p class="calibre6">through Christ our Lord. </p>

<p class="rubric">97. And he continues: </p>

<p class="calibre6">Through whom <br class="sline">  
	you continue to make all these good things, O Lord; <br class="sline">  
	you sanctify them, fill them with life, <br class="sline"> 
	bless them, and bestow them upon us. </p>

<p class="rubric">98. He takes the chalice and the paten with the host and, raising both, he says: </p>

<p class="calibre6">Through him, and with him, and in him, <br class="sline">
	O God, almighty Father, <br class="sline"> 
	in the unity of the Holy Spirit, <br class="sline"> 
	all glory and honor is yours, <br class="sline"> 
	for ever and ever.</p>

<p class="rubric">The people acclaim: </p>

<p class="response">Amen. </p>
