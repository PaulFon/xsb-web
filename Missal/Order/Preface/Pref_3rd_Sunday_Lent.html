<h3 class="calibre2">The Samaritan Woman</h3>

<p class="calibre6">It is truly right and just, our duty and our salvation, <br class="sline">
always and everywhere to give you thanks, <br class="sline">
Lord, holy Father, almighty and eternal God. <br class="sline">
Through Christ our Lord </p>

<p class="calibre6">  For when he asked the Samaritan woman <br class="sline">
for water to drink, <br class="sline">
he had already created the gift of faith within her <br class="sline">
and so ardently did he thirst for her faith, <br class="sline">
that he kindled in her the fire of divine love. </p>

<p class="calibre6"> And so we, too, give you thanks <br class="sline">
and with the Angels <br class="sline">
praise your mighty deeds, as we acclaim:</p>
