<h3 class="calibre2">The renewal of all things in Christ</h3>

<p class="rubric">72. The following Preface is 
said in Masses that have no proper Preface, and for which a Preface related to
a specific liturgical time is not indicated. </p>

<p class="calibre6">It is truly right and just, <br class="sline">
our duty and our salvation, <br class="sline">
always and everywhere to give you thanks, <br class="sline">
Lord, holy Father, almighty and eternal God, <br class="sline">
through Christ our Lord. </p>

<p class="calibre6">In him you have been pleased <br class="sline">
to renew all things, <br class="sline">
giving us all a share in his fullness. <br class="sline">
For though he was in the form of God, <br class="sline">
he emptied himself <br class="sline">
and by the blood of his Cross <br class="sline">
brought peace to all creation. <br class="sline">
Therefore he has been exalted above all things, <br class="sline">
and to all who obey him, <br class="sline">
has become the source of eternal salvation. </p>

<p class="calibre6">And so, with Angels and Archangels, <br class="sline">
with Thrones and Dominions, <br class="sline">
and with all the hosts and Powers of heaven, <br class="sline">
we sing the hymn of your glory, <br class="sline">
as without end we acclaim: </p>
