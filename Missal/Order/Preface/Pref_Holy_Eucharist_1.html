    who instituted the pattern of an everlasting sacrifice <br class="sline"> 
    and was the first to offer himself as the saving Victim, <br class="sline"> 
    commanding us to make this offering as his memorial. <br class="sline">As we eat his flesh that was sacrificed for us, <br class="sline"> 
    we are made strong, <br class="sline"> 
    and, as we drink his Blood that was poured out for us, <br class="sline"> 
    we are washed clean. <br class="sline">
    And so, with Angels and Archangels, <br class="sline"> 
    with Thrones and Dominions, <br class="sline"> 
    and with all the hosts and Powers of heaven, <br class="sline"> 
    we sing the hymn of your glory, <br class="sline"> 
    as without end we acclaim:
