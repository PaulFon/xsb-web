<div class="poetry">
<p> It is truly right and just, our duty and our salvation, <br class="sline"> 
    always and everywhere to give you thanks, <br class="sline"> 
    Lord, holy Father, almighty and eternal God. <br class="sline">
    For with your Only Begotten Son and the Holy Spirit <br class="sline"> 
    you are one God, one Lord: <br class="sline"> 
    not in the unity of a single person, <br class="sline"> 
    but in a Trinity of one substance. <br class="sline"> 
    For what you have revealed to us of your glory <br class="sline"> 
    we believe equally of your Son <br class="sline"> 
    and of the Holy Spirit, <br class="sline"> 
    so that, in the confessing of the true and eternal Godhead, <br class="sline"> 
    you might be adored in what is proper to each Person, <br class="sline"> 
    their unity in substance, <br class="sline"> 
    and their equality in majesty. <br class="sline"> 
    For this is praised by Angels and Archangels, <br class="sline"> 
    Cherubim, too, and Seraphim, <br class="sline"> 
    who never cease to cry out each day, <br class="sline"> 
    as with one voice they acclaim:
