<h3 class="calibre2">Christ, Priest and Victim</h3>

<p class="rubric">49. The following Preface is said during Easter Time. </p>

<p class="calibre6">It is truly right and just, our duty and our salvation, <br class="sline">
	at all times to acclaim you, O Lord, <br class="sline">
	but in this time above all to laud you yet more gloriously, <br class="sline">
	when Christ our Passover has been sacrificed. </p>

<p class="calibre6">By the oblation of his Body <br class="sline">
	he brought the sacrifices of old to fulfilment <br class="sline">
	in the reality of the Cross <br class="sline">
	and, by commending himself to you for our salvation, <br class="sline">
	showed himself the Priest, the Altar and the Lamb of sacrifice. </p>

<p class="calibre6">Therefore, overcome with paschal joy, <br class="sline">
	every land, every people exults in your praise <br class="sline">
	and even the heavenly Powers, with the angelic hosts, <br class="sline">
	sing together the unending hymn of your glory, as they acclaim: </p>
