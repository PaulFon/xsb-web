<p class="calibre6">It is truly right and just, our duty and our salvation, <br class="sline">
	at all times to acclaim you, O Lord, <br class="sline">
	but in this time above all to laud you yet more gloriously, <br class="sline">
	when Christ our Passover has been sacrificed. </p>

<p class="calibre6">Through him the children of light rise to eternal life <br class="sline">
	and the halls of the heavenly Kingdom <br class="sline">
	are thrown open to the faithful; <br class="sline">
	for his Death is our ransom from death, <br class="sline">
	and in his rising the life of all has risen. </p>

<p class="calibre6">Therefore, overcome with paschal joy, <br class="sline">
	every land, every people exults in your praise <br class="sline">
	and even the heavenly Powers, with the angelic hosts, <br class="sline">
	sing together the unending hymn of your glory, <br class="sline">
	as they acclaim: </p>
