<h3 class="calibre2">The restoration of the universe through the Paschal Mystery</h3>

<p class="rubric">49. The following Preface is said during Easter Time. </p>

<p class="calibre6">It is truly right and just, our duty and our salvation, <br class="sline">
	at all times to acclaim you, O Lord, <br class="sline">
	but in this time above all to laud you yet more gloriously, <br class="sline">
	when Christ our Passover has been sacrificed. </p>

<p class="calibre6">For, with the old order destroyed, <br class="sline">
	a universe cast down is renewed, <br class="sline">
	and integrity of life is restored to us in Christ. </p>

<p class="calibre6">Therefore, overcome with paschal joy, <br class="sline">
	every land, every people exults in your praise <br class="sline">
	and even the heavenly Powers, with the angelic hosts,<br class="sline">
	sing together the unending hymn of your glory, as they acclaim: </p>
