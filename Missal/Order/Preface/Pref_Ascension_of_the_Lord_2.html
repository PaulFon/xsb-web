<h3 class="calibre2">The mystery of the Ascension</h3>

<p class="rubric">51. The following Preface is said on the day of the Ascension of the Lord. It may be said on the days between the Ascension and Pentecost in all Masses that have no proper Preface. </p>

<p class="calibre6">It is truly right and just, our duty and our salvation, <br class="sline"> 
    always and everywhere to give you thanks, <br class="sline">
    Lord, holy Father, almighty and eternal God, <br class="sline">
    through Christ our Lord. </p>

<p class="calibre6">For after his Resurrection <br class="sline">
    he plainly appeared to all his disciples <br class="sline">
    and was taken up to heaven in their sight, <br class="sline">
    that he might make us sharers in his divinity. </p>

<p class="calibre6">Therefore, overcome with paschal joy, <br class="sline">
    every land, every people exults in your praise <br class="sline">
    and even the heavenly Powers, with the angelic hosts, <br class="sline">
    sing together the unending hymn of your glory, <br class="sline">as they acclaim: </p>
