<h3 class="calibre2">The spiritual meaning of Lent</h3>

<p class="rubric">39. The following Preface is
said in Masses of Lent, especially on Sundays when a more specific Preface is
not prescribed. </p>

<p class="calibre6">It is truly right and just, our duty and our salvation, <br class="sline">
always and everywhere to give you thanks, <br class="sline">
Lord, holy Father, almighty and eternal God. </p>

<p class="calibre6">For by your gracious gift each year <br class="sline">
your faithful await the sacred paschal feasts <br class="sline">
with the joy of minds made pure, <br class="sline">
so that, more eagerly intent on prayer <br class="sline">
and on the works of charity, <br class="sline">
and participating in the mysteries <br class="sline">
by which they have been reborn, <br class="sline">
they may be led to the fullness of grace <br class="sline">
that you bestow on your sons and daughters. </p>

<p class="calibre6">And so, with Angels and Archangels, <br class="sline">
with Thrones and Dominions, <br class="sline">
and with all the hosts and Powers of heaven, <br class="sline">
we sing the hymn of your glory, <br class="sline">
as without end we acclaim: </p>
