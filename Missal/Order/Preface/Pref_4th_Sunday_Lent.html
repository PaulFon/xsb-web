<h3 class="calibre2">The man born blind</h3>

<p class="calibre6">It is truly right and just, our duty and our salvation, <br class="sline">
always and everywhere to give you thanks, <br class="sline">
Lord, holy Father, almighty and eternal God. <br class="sline">
Through Christ our Lord</p>

<p class="calibre6"> By the mystery of the Incarnation, <br class="sline">
he has led the human race that walked in darkness <br class="sline">
into the radiance of the faith <br class="sline">
and has brought those born in slavery to ancient sin <br class="sline">
through the waters of regeneration <br class="sline">
to make them your adopted children. </p>

<p class="calibre6"> Therefore, all creatures of heaven and earth <br class="sline">
sing a new song in adoration, <br class="sline">
and we, with all the host of Angels, <br class="sline">
cry out and without end acclaim:</p>
