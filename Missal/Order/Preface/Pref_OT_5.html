<p class="calibre6">It is truly right and just, our duty and our salvation, <br class="sline">
    always and everywhere to give you thanks, <br class="sline">
    Lord, holy Father, almighty and eternal God. </p>

<p class="calibre6">For you laid the foundations of the world <br class="sline">
    and have arranged the changing of times and seasons; <br class="sline">
    you formed man in your own image <br class="sline">
    and set humanity over the whole world in all its wonder, <br class="sline">
    to rule in your name over all you have made <br class="sline">
    and forever praise you in your mighty works, <br class="sline">
    through Christ our Lord. </p>

<p class="calibre6">And so, with all the Angels, we praise you, <br class="sline">
as in joyful celebration we acclaim: </p>
