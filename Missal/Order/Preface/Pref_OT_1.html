<h2>PREFACE I OF THE SUNDAYS IN ORDINARY TIME </h2>

<h3 class="calibre2">The Paschal Mystery and the People of God</h3>

<p class="rubric">52. The following Preface is said on Sundays in Ordinary Time. </p>

<p class="calibre6">It is truly right and just, our duty and our salvation, <br class="sline">
always and everywhere to give you thanks, <br class="sline">
Lord, holy Father, almighty and eternal God, <br class="sline">
through Christ our Lord. </p>

<p class="calibre6">For through his Paschal Mystery, <br class="sline">
    he accomplished the marvellous deed, <br class="sline">
    by which he has freed us from the yoke of sin and death, <br class="sline">
    summoning us to the glory of being now called <br class="sline">
    a chosen race, a royal priesthood, <br class="sline">
    a holy nation, a people for your own possession, <br class="sline">
    to proclaim everywhere your mighty works, <br class="sline">
    for you have called us out of darkness <br class="sline">
    into your own wonderful light. </p>

<p class="calibre6">And so, with Angels and Archangels, <br class="sline">
    with Thrones and Dominions, <br class="sline">
    and with all the hosts and Powers of heaven, <br class="sline">
    we sing the hymn of your glory, <br class="sline">
    as without end we acclaim: </p>
