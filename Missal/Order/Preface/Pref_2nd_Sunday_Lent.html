<h3 class="calibre2">The Transfiguration of the Lord</h3>

<p class="calibre6">It is truly right and just, our duty and our salvation, <br class="sline">
always and everywhere to give you thanks, <br class="sline">
Lord, holy Father, almighty and eternal God. <br class="sline">
Through Christ our Lord </p>

<p class="calibre6"> For after he had told the disciples of his coming Death, <br class="sline">
on the holy mountain he manifested to them his glory, <br class="sline">
to show, even by the testimony of the law and the prophets, <br class="sline">
    that the Passion leads to the glory of the Resurrection. </p>

<p class="calibre6"> And so, with the Powers of heaven, <br class="sline">
we worship you constantly on earth, <br class="sline">
and before your majesty <br class="sline">
without end we acclaim:</p>
