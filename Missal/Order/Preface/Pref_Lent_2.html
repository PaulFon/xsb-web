<p class="rubric">40. The following Preface is said in Masses of Lent, especially on Sundays when a more specific Preface is not prescribed. </p>

<p class="calibre6">It is truly right and just, our duty and our salvation, <br class="sline">
always and everywhere to give you thanks, <br class="sline">
Lord, holy Father, almighty and eternal God. </p>

<p class="calibre6">For you have given your children a sacred time <br class="sline">
for the renewing and purifying of their hearts, <br class="sline">
that, freed from disordered affections, <br class="sline">
they may so deal with the things of this passing world <br class="sline">
as to hold rather to the things that eternally endure. </p>

<p class="calibre6">And so we glorify you with countless Angels, <br class="sline">
as with one voice of praise we acclaim: </p>
