<p class="calibre6">It is truly
right to give you thanks, <br class="sline">
truly just to give you glory, Father most holy, <br class="sline">
for you are the one God living and true, <br class="sline">
existing before all ages and abiding for all eternity, <br class="sline">
dwelling in unapproachable light; <br class="sline">
yet you, who alone are good, the source of life, <br class="sline">
have made all that is, <br class="sline">
so that you might fill your creatures with blessings <br class="sline">
and bring joy to many of them by the glory of your light. </p>

<p class="calibre6">And so, in your presence are countless hosts of Angels, <br class="sline">
who serve you day and night <br class="sline">
and, gazing upon the glory of your face, <br class="sline">
glorify you without ceasing. </p>

<p class="calibre6">With them we, too, confess your name in exultation, <br class="sline">
giving voice to every creature under heaven, <br class="sline">
as we acclaim: </p>
