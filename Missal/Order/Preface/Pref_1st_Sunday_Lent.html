<h3 class="calibre2">The temptation of the Lord</h3>

<p class="rubric"> - </p>

<p class="calibre6">It is truly right and just, our duty and our salvation, <br class="sline">
always and everywhere to give you thanks, <br class="sline">
Lord, holy Father, almighty and eternal God. <br class="sline">
Through Christ our Lord </p>

<p class="calibre6">By abstaining forty long days from earthly food, <br class="sline">
    he consecrated through his fast <br class="sline">
    the pattern of our Lenten observance <br class="sline">
    and, by overturning all the snares of the ancient serpent, <br class="sline">
    taught us to cast out the leaven of malice, <br class="sline">
    so that, celebrating worthily the Paschal Mystery, <br class="sline">
    we might pass over at last to the eternal paschal feast. <br class="sline">
    And so, with the company of Angels and Saints, <br class="sline">
    we sing the hymn of your praise, <br class="sline">
    as without end we acclaim:</p>
 


<p class="calibre6">And so we glorify you with countless Angels, <br class="sline">
as with one voice of praise we acclaim: </p>
