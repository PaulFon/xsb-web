<h3 class="calibre2">The passion of the Lord</h3>

<p class="rubric"> - </p>

<p class="calibre6">It is truly right and just, our duty and our salvation, <br class="sline">
always and everywhere to give you thanks, <br class="sline">
Lord, holy Father, almighty and eternal God. <br class="sline">
Through Christ our Lord </p>

<p class="calibre6">For though innocent he suffered willingly for sinners <br class="sline">
    and accepted unjust condemnation to save the guilty. <br class="sline">
    His Death has washed away our sins, <br class="sline">
    and his Resurrection has purchased our justification. <br class="sline">
    And so, with all the Angels, <br class="sline">
    we praise you, as in joyful celebration we, too, acclaim: <br class="sline">
    as without end we acclaim:</p>
