<h2>PREFACE II OF THE SUNDAYS IN ORDINARY TIME </h2>

<h3 class="calibre2">The mystery of salvation</h3>

<p class="rubric">53. The following Preface is said on Sundays in Ordinary Time. </p>

<p class="calibre6">It is truly right and just, our duty and our salvation, <br class="sline">
    always and everywhere to give you thanks, <br class="sline">
    Lord, holy Father, almighty and eternal God, <br class="sline">
    through Christ our Lord. </p>

<p class="calibre6">For out of compassion for the waywardness that is ours, <br class="sline">
    he humbled himself and was born of the Virgin; <br class="sline">
    by the passion of the Cross he freed us from unending death, <br class="sline">
    and by rising from the dead he gave us life eternal. </p>

<p class="calibre6">And so, with Angels and Archangels, <br class="sline">
    with Thrones and Dominions, <br class="sline">
    and with all the hosts and Powers of heaven, <br class="sline">
    we sing the hymn of your glory, <br class="sline">
    as without end we acclaim: </p>
