<h3 class="calibre2">Salvation through the obedience of Christ</h3>

<p class="rubric">58. The following Preface is said on Sundays in Ordinary Time. </p>

<p class="calibre6">It is truly right and just, our duty and our salvation, <br class="sline">
    always and everywhere to give you thanks, <br class="sline">
    Lord, holy Father, almighty and eternal God. </p>

<p class="calibre6">For you so loved the world <br class="sline">
    that in your mercy you sent us the Redeemer, <br class="sline">
    to live like us in all things but sin, <br class="sline">
    so that you might love in us what you loved in your Son, <br class="sline">
    by whose obedience we have been restored to those gifts <br class="sline">
    of yours that, <br class="sline">
    by sinning, we had lost in disobedience.
</p>

<p class="calibre6">And so, Lord, with all the Angels and Saints, <br class="sline">
we, too, give you thanks, as in exultation we acclaim: </p>
