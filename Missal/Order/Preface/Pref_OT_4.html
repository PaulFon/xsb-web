<h3 class="calibre2">The history of salvation</h3>

<p class="rubric">55. The following Preface is said on Sundays in Ordinary Time. </p>

<p class="calibre6">It is truly right and just, our duty and our salvation, <br class="sline">
    always and everywhere to give you thanks, <br class="sline">
    Lord, holy Father, almighty and eternal God. </p>

<p class="calibre6">For by his birth he brought renewal <br class="sline">
    to humanity’s fallen state, <br class="sline">
    and by his suffering, cancelled out our sins; <br class="sline">
    by his rising from the dead, <br class="sline">
    he has opened the way to eternal life, <br class="sline">
    and by ascending to you, O Father, <br class="sline">
    he has unlocked the gates of heaven. </p>

<p class="calibre6">And so, with the company of Angels and Saints, <br class="sline">we sing the hymn of your praise, <br class="sline">
    as without end we acclaim: </p>
