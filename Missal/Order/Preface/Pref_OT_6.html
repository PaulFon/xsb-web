<h3 class="calibre2">The pledge of the eternal Passover</h3>

<p class="rubric">57. The following Preface is
said on Sundays in Ordinary Time. </p>

<p class="calibre6">It is truly right and just, our duty and our salvation, <br class="sline">
    always and everywhere to give you thanks, <br class="sline">
    Lord, holy Father, almighty and eternal God. </p>

<p class="calibre6">For in you we live and move and have our being, <br class="sline">
    and while in this body <br class="sline">
    we not only experience the daily effects of your care, <br class="sline">
    but even now possess the pledge of life eternal. </p>
    
<p class="calibre6">For, having received the first fruits of the Spirit, <br class="sline">
    through whom you raised up Jesus from the dead, <br class="sline">
    we hope for an everlasting share in the Paschal Mystery. </p>

<p class="calibre6">And so, with all the Angels, we praise you, <br class="sline">
    as in joyful celebration we acclaim: </p>
