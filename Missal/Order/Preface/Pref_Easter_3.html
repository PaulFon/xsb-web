<h2 class="calibre10">PREFACE III OF EASTER</h2>
<h3 class="calibre2">Christ living and always interceding for us</h3>
<p class="calibre6">It is truly right and just, our duty and our salvation, <br class="sline">
	at all times to acclaim you, O Lord, <br class="sline">
	but in this time above all to laud you yet more gloriously, <br class="sline">
	when Christ our Passover has been sacrificed. </p>

<p class="calibre6">He never ceases to offer himself for us <br class="sline">
	but defends us and ever pleads our cause before you: <br class="sline">
	he is the sacrificial Victim who dies no more, <br class="sline">
	the Lamb, once slain, who lives forever. </p>

<p class="calibre6">Therefore, overcome with paschal joy, <br class="sline">
	every land, every people exults in your praise <br class="sline">
	and even the heavenly Powers, with the angelic hosts, <br class="sline">
	sing together the unending hymn of your glory, as they acclaim: </p>
