<h3 class="calibre2">The salvation of man by a man</h3>

<p class="rubric">54. The following Preface is said on Sundays in Ordinary Time. </p>

<p class="calibre6">It is truly right and just, our duty and our salvation, <br class="sline">
    always and everywhere to give you thanks, <br class="sline">
    Lord, holy Father, almighty and eternal God. </p>

<p class="calibre6">For we know it belongs to your boundless glory, <br class="sline">
    that you came to the aid of mortal beings with your divinity <br class="sline">
    and even fashioned for us a remedy out of mortality itself, <br class="sline">
    that the cause of our downfall <br class="sline">
    might become the means of our salvation, <br class="sline">
    through Christ our Lord. </p>

<p class="calibre6">Through him the host of Angels adores your majesty <br class="sline">
    and rejoices in your presence for ever. <br class="sline">
    May our voices, we pray, join with theirs <br class="sline">
    in one chorus of exultant praise, as we acclaim: </p>
