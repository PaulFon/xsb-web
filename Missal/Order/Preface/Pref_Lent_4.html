<h3 class="calibre2">The fruits of fasting</h3>

<p class="rubric">42. The following Preface is
said in Masses of the weekdays of Lent and on days of fasting. </p>

<p class="calibre6">It is truly right and just, our duty and our salvation, <br class="sline">
always and everywhere to give you thanks, <br class="sline">
Lord, holy Father, almighty and eternal God. </p>

<p class="calibre6">For through bodily fasting you restrain our faults, <br class="sline">
raise up our minds, <br class="sline">
and bestow both virtue and its rewards, <br class="sline">
through Christ our Lord. </p>

<p class="calibre6">Through him the Angels praise your majesty, <br class="sline">
Dominions adore and Powers tremble before you. <br class="sline">
Heaven and the Virtues of heaven and the blessed Seraphim <br class="sline">
worship together with exultation. <br class="sline">
May our voices, we pray, join with theirs <br class="sline">
in humble praise, as we acclaim: </p>
