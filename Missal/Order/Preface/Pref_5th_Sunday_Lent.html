<h3 class="calibre2">Lazarus</h3>

<p class="calibre6">It is truly right and just, our duty and our salvation, <br class="sline">
always and everywhere to give you thanks, <br class="sline">
Lord, holy Father, almighty and eternal God. <br class="sline">
Through Christ our Lord</p>

<p class="calibre6">For as true man he wept for Lazarus his friend <br class="sline">
and as eternal God raised him from the tomb, <br class="sline">
just as, taking pity on the human race, <br class="sline">
he leads us by sacred mysteries to new life. </p>

<p class="calibre6">Through him the host of Angels adores your majesty <br class="sline">
and rejoices in your presence for ever. <br class="sline">
May our voices, we pray, join with theirs <br class="sline">
in one chorus of exultant praise, as we acclaim:</p>
