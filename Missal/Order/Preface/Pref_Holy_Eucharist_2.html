<h4>Preface Holy Eucharist II The Fruits of the Most Holy Eucharist </h4>
<div class="poetry">
<p> It is truly right and just, our duty and our salvation, <br class="sline"> 
    always and everywhere to give you thanks, <br class="sline"> 
    Lord, holy Father, almighty and eternal God, <br class="sline"> 
    through Christ our Lord. <br class="sline"> 
    For at the Last Supper with his Apostles, <br class="sline"> 
    establishing for the ages to come the saving memorial <br class="sline"> 
    of the Cross, <br class="sline"> 
    he offered himself to you as the unblemished Lamb, <br class="sline"> 
    the acceptable gift of perfect praise. <br class="sline"> 
    Nourishing your faithful by this sacred mystery, <br class="sline"> 
    you make them holy, so that the human race, <br class="sline"> 
    bounded by one world, <br class="sline"> 
    may be enlightened by one faith <br class="sline"> 
    and united by one bond of charity. <br class="sline"> 
    And so, we approach the table of this wondrous Sacrament, <br class="sline"> 
    so that, bathed in the sweetness of your grace, <br class="sline"> 
    we may pass over to the heavenly realities <br class="sline"> 
    here foreshadowed. <br class="sline"> 
    Therefore, all creatures of heaven and earth <br class="sline"> 
    sing a new song in adoration, <br class="sline"> 
    and we, with all the host of Angels, <br class="sline"> 
    cry out, and without end we acclaim:
