<h3 class="calibre2">The mystery of the Ascension</h3>

<p class="rubric">50. The following Preface is said on the day of the Ascension of the Lord. It may be said on the days between the Ascension and Pentecost in all Masses that have no proper Preface.. </p>

<p class="calibre6">It is truly right and just, our duty and our salvation, <br class="sline">
always and everywhere to give you thanks, <br class="sline">
Lord, holy Father, almighty and eternal God.</p>

<p class="calibre6">For the Lord Jesus, the King of glory, <br class="sline">
    conqueror of sin and death, <br class="sline">
    ascended (today) to the highest heavens, <br class="sline">
    as the Angels gazed in wonder.</p>

<p class="calibre6">Mediator between God and man, <br class="sline">
    judge of the world and Lord of hosts, <br class="sline">
    he ascended not to distance himself from our lowly state <br class="sline">
    but that we, his members, might be confident of following <br class="sline">
    where he, our Head and Founder, has gone before.</p>

<p class="calibre6">Therefore, overcome with paschal joy, <br class="sline">
    every land, every people exults in your praise <br class="sline">
    and even the heavenly Powers, with the angelic hosts, <br class="sline">
    sing together the unending hymn of your glory, <br class="sline">
    as they acclaim:</p>
