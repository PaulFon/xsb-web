<p class="rubric">137. When the distribution of Communion is over, the Priest or a Deacon or an acolyte purifies the paten over the chalice and also the chalice itself. <br class="wordsection"/>While he carries out the purification, the Priest says quietly: </p>

<p class="quietly">What has passed our lips as food, O Lord, may we possess in purity of heart, that what has been given to us in time may be our healing for eternity. </p>

<p class="rubric">138. Then the Priest may return to the chair. If appropriate, a sacred silence may be observed for a while, or a psalm or other canticle of praise or a hymn may be sung. <br class="wordsection"/>
139. Then, standing at the altar or at the chair and facing the people, with hands joined, the Priest says: </p>

<p class="calibre6">Let us pray. </p>

<p class="rubric">All pray in silence with the Priest for a while, unless silence has just been observed. Then the Priest, with hands extended, says the Prayer after Communion, at the end of which the people acclaim: </p>

<p class="response">Amen. </p>
