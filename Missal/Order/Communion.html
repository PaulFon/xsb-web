<p class="calibre6">Behold the
Lamb of God,<br class="wordsection"/>
behold him who takes away the sins of the world. <br class="wordsection"/>
Blessed are those called to the supper of the Lamb. </p>

<p class="rubric">And
together with the people he adds once: </p>

<p class="all">Lord,
I am not worthy <br class="wordsection"/>
that you should enter under my roof, <br class="wordsection"/>
but only say the word and my soul shall be healed. </p>

<p class="rubric">133.
The Priest, facing the altar, says quietly: </p>

<p class="quietly">May
the Body of Christ keep me safe for eternal life. </p>

<p class="rubric">And
he reverently consumes the Body of Christ. Then he takes the chalice and says
quietly: </p>

<p class="quietly">May
the Blood of Christ keep me safe for eternal life. </p>

<p class="rubric">And
he reverently consumes the Blood of Christ. </p>

<p class="rubric">134. After this, he takes the paten or ciborium and approaches the communicants. The
Priest raises a host slightly and shows it to each of the communicants, saying: </p>

<p class="calibre6">The Body of Christ. </p>

<p class="rubric">The communicant replies: </p>

<p class="response">Amen. </p>

<p class="rubric">And receives Holy Communion. If a Deacon also distributes Holy Communion, he does so in the same manner.<br class="wordsection"/>
135. If any are present who are to receive Holy Communion under both kinds, the rite described in the proper place is to be followed. <br class="wordsection"/>
136. While the Priest is receiving the Body of Christ, the Communion Chant begins. <br class="wordsection"/>
137. When the distribution of Communion is over, the Priest or a Deacon or an acolyte purifies the paten over the chalice and also the chalice itself. <br class="wordsection"/>While he carries out the purification, the Priest says quietly: </p>

<p class="quietly">What has passed our lips as food, O Lord, may we possess in purity of heart, that
what has been given to us in time may be our healing for eternity. </p>

<p class="rubric">138. Then the Priest may return to the chair. If appropriate, a sacred silence may
be observed for a while, or a psalm or other canticle of praise or a hymn may be sung. <br class="wordsection"/>
139. Then, standing at the altar or at the chair and facing the people, with hands joined, the Priest says: </p>

<p class="calibre6">Let us pray. </p>

<p class="rubric">All
pray in silence with the Priest for a while, unless silence has just been
observed. Then the Priest, with hands extended, says the Prayer after
Communion, at the end of which the people acclaim: </p>

<p class="response">Amen. </p>
