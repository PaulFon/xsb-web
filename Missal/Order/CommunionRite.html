<p class="rubric">124. After the chalice and paten
have been set down, the Priest, with hands joined, says: </p>

<p class="calibre6">At the Savior’s command <br class="sline">
and formed by divine teaching, we dare to say: <span class="opt">[pray]</span></p>

<p class="rubric">He extends his hands and,
together with the people, continues: </p>

<p class="all">Our Father, who art in heaven, <br class="sline">
hallowed be thy name; <br class="sline">
thy kingdom come, <br class="sline">
thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven. <br class="sline">
Give us this day our daily bread, <br class="sline">
and forgive us our trespasses, <br class="sline">
as we forgive those who trespass against us; <br class="sline">
and lead us not into temptation, <br class="sline">
but deliver us from evil. </p>

<p class="rubric">125. With hands extended, the Priest alone continues, saying: </p>

<p class="calibre6">Deliver us, Lord, we pray, from every evil, <br class="sline">
graciously grant peace in our days, <br class="sline">
that, by the help of your mercy, <br class="sline">
we may be always free from sin and safe from all distress, <br class="sline">
as we await the blessed hope <br class="sline">
and the coming of our Savior, Jesus Christ. </p>

<p class="rubric">He joins his hands. The people conclude the prayer, acclaiming: </p>

<p class="response">For the kingdom, <br class="sline">
the power and the glory are yours now and for ever. </p>

<p class="rubric">126. Then the Priest, with hands extended, says aloud: </p>

<p class="calibre6">Lord Jesus Christ, who said to your Apostles: <br class="sline">
Peace I leave you, my peace I give you; <br class="sline">
look not on our sins, but on the faith of your Church, <br class="sline">
and graciously grant her peace and unity <br class="sline">
in accordance with your will. </p>

<p class="rubric">He joins his hands. </p>

<p class="calibre6">Who live and reign for ever and ever. </p>

<p class="rubric">The people reply: </p>

<p class="response">Amen.</p>

<p class="rubric">127. The Priest, turned towards
the people, extending and then joining his hands, adds: </p>

<p class="calibre6">The peace of the Lord be with you always. </p>

<p class="rubric">The people reply: </p>

<p class="response">And with your spirit. </p>

<p class="rubric">128. Then, if appropriate, the
Deacon, or the Priest, adds: </p>

<p class="calibre6">Let us offer each other the sign of peace. </p>

<p class="rubric">And all offer one another a sign, in keeping with local customs, that expresses peace, communion, and charity. The Priest gives the sign of peace to a Deacon or minister. </p>


<p class="rubric"><a id="CR2"></a>129. Then he takes the host, breaks it over the paten, and places a small piece in the chalice, saying quietly: </p>

<p class="quietly">May this mingling of the Body and Blood of our Lord Jesus Christ bring eternal life to us who receive it.</p>
