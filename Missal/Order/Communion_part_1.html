<p class="calibre6">Behold the Lamb of God,<br class="wordsection"/>
behold him who takes away the sins of the world. <br class="wordsection"/>
Blessed are those called to the supper of the Lamb. </p>
<p class="rubric">And together with the people he adds once: </p>
<p class="all">Lord, I am not worthy <br class="wordsection"/>
that you should enter under my roof, <br class="wordsection"/>
but only say the word and my soul shall be healed. </p>
<p class="rubric">133. The Priest, facing the altar, says quietly: </p>
<p class="quietly">May the Body of Christ keep me safe for eternal life. </p>
<p class="rubric">And he reverently consumes the Body of Christ. Then he takes the chalice and says quietly: </p>
<p class="quietly">May the Blood of Christ keep me safe for eternal life. </p>
<p class="rubric">And he reverently consumes the Blood of Christ. </p>
