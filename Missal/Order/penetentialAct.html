<h2>Penitential Act</h2>

<p class="rubric">From time to time on Sundays, especially in Easter Time, instead of the customary Penitential Act, the blessing and sprinkling of water may take place (as in Appendix II) as a reminder of Baptism.</p>

<p class="rubric">4. Then follows the Penitential Act, to which the Priest invites the faithful, saying: </p>

<p class="calibre6">Brethren (brothers and sisters), let us acknowledge our sins, <br class="sline">
and so prepare ourselves to celebrate the sacred mysteries. </p>

<p class="rubric">A brief pause for silence
follows. Then all recite together the formula of general confession: </p>

<p class="all">I confess to almighty God and to you, <br class="sline">
my brothers and sisters, <br class="sline">
that I have greatly sinned, <br class="sline">
in my thoughts and in my words, <br class="sline">
in what I have done and in what I have failed to do, </p>

<p class="rubric">And, striking their breast, they say: </p>

<p class="all">through my fault, through my fault, <br class="sline">
through my most grievous fault; </p>

<p class="rubric">Then they continue: </p>

<p class="all">therefore I ask blessed Mary
ever-Virgin, <br class="sline">
all the Angels and Saints, <br class="sline">
and you, my brothers and sisters, <br class="sline">
to pray for me to the Lord our God. </p>

<p class="rubric">The absolution by the Priest
follows: </p>

<p class="calibre6">May almighty God have mercy on us, <br class="sline">
forgive us our sins, <br class="sline">
and bring us to everlasting life. </p>

<p class="rubric">The people reply: </p>

<div class="response">R. Amen. </div>

<p class="rubric">The Priest (or Cantor if sung): </p>

<div id="englishOption">
    Lord, have mercy. R. Lord, have mercy.<br class="sline">
    Christ, have mercy. R. Christ, have mercy. <br class="sline">

<p class="calibre6">Brothers and sisters, let us acknowledge our sins, <br class="sline">
and so prepare ourselves to celebrate the sacred mysteries. </p>

<div class="response">And grant us your salvation. </div>

<p class="rubric">The absolution by the Priest follows: </p>
