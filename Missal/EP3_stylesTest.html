Program Description: Modified from iPriest Roman Missal SE USA - Roman Missal ICEL_split_327.htm
Version 2.0 07/29/2020 - Made big changes to the styles. Added a class for the <br> tags called "sline" (sense line) that will allow me to render the br differently for different uses.

<p class="rubric">108.
The Priest, with hands extended, says: </p>

<p>You are indeed Holy, O Lord, <br class="sline">
and all you have created rightly gives you praise, <br class="sline">
for through your Son our Lord Jesus Christ, <br class="sline">
by the power and working of the Holy Spirit, <br class="sline">
you give life to all things and make them holy, <br class="sline">
and you never cease to gather a people to yourself, <br class="sline">
so that from the rising of the sun to its setting <br class="sline">
a pure sacrifice may be offered to your name. </p>

<p class="rubric">109.
He joins his hands and, holding them extended over the offerings, says: </p>

<p class="calibre6">Therefore, O Lord, we humbly implore you: <br class="sline">
by the same Spirit graciously make holy <br class="sline">
these gifts we have brought to you for consecration, </p>

<p class="rubric">He joins his hands and makes the Sign of the Cross once over the bread and chalice together, saying: </p>

<p class="calibre6">that they may become the Body and <span class="red1">+</span> Blood <br class="sline">
 of your Son our Lord Jesus Christ, </p>

<p class="rubric">He joins his hands. </p>

<p class="calibre6">at whose command we celebrate these mysteries. </p>

<p class="rubric">110. In the formulas that follow, the words of the Lord should be pronounced clearly and distinctly, as the nature of these words requires. </p>

<p class="calibre6">For on the night he was betrayed </p>

<p class="rubric">He takes the bread and, holding
it slightly raised above the altar, continues: </p>

<p class="calibre6">he himself took bread, <br class="sline">
and, giving you thanks, he said the blessing, <br class="sline">
broke the bread and gave it to his disciples, saying: </p>

<p class="rubric">He bows slightly. </p>

<p class="calibre6">Take this, all of you, and eat of it, <br class="sline">
    for this is my body, which will be given up for you. </p>

<p class="rubric">He shows the consecrated host to the people, places it again on the paten, and genuflects in adoration. After this, he continues: </p>

<p class="calibre6">In a similar way, when supper was ended, </p>

<p class="rubric">He takes the chalice and,
holding it slightly raised above the altar, continues: </p>

<p class="calibre6">he took the chalice, <br class="sline">
    and, giving you thanks, he said the blessing, <br class="sline">
    and gave the chalice to his disciples, saying: </p>

<p class="rubric">He bows slightly. </p>

<p class="calibre6">Take this, all of you, and drink from it, <br class="sline">
    for this is the chalice of my blood, <br class="sline">
    the blood of the new and eternal covenant, <br class="sline">
    which will be poured out for you and for many <br class="sline">
    for the forgiveness of sins. </p>

<p class="calibre6">Do this in memory of me.</p>

<p class="rubric">He shows the chalice to the people, places it on the corporal, and genuflects in adoration. </p>

<p class="rubric">112. Then he says: </p>

<p class="calibre6">The mystery of faith. </p>

<p class="rubric">And the people continue, acclaiming: </p>

<p class="response">We proclaim your Death, O Lord, <br class="sline">
and profess your Resurrection <br class="sline">
until you come again. </p>

<p class="rubric">or: </p>

<p class="response">When we eat this Bread and drink this Cup, <br class="sline">
    we proclaim your Death, O Lord, <br class="sline">
    until you come again. </p>

<p class="rubric">or: </p>

<p class="response">Save us, Savior of the world, <br class="sline">
for by your Cross and Resurrection <br class="sline">
    you have set us free. </p>

<p class="rubric">113. Then the Priest, with hands extended, says: </p>

<p class="calibre6">Therefore, O Lord, as we celebrate the memorial <br class="sline">
    of the saving Passion of your Son, <br class="sline">
    his wondrous Resurrection <br class="sline">
    and Ascension into heaven, <br class="sline">
    and as we look forward to his second coming, <br class="sline">
    we offer you in thanksgiving <br class="sline">
    this holy and living sacrifice. </p>

<p class="calibre6">Look, we pray, upon the oblation of your Church <br class="sline">
    and, recognizing the sacrificial Victim by whose death <br class="sline">
    you willed to reconcile us to yourself, <br class="sline">
    grant that we, who are nourished <br class="sline">
    by the Body and Blood of your Son <br class="sline">
    and filled with his Holy Spirit, <br class="sline">
    may become one body, one spirit in Christ. </p>

<p class="calibre6">May he make of us <br class="sline">
    an eternal offering to you, <br class="sline">
so that we may obtain an inheritance with your elect, <br class="sline">
especially with the most Blessed Virgin Mary, Mother of God, <br class="sline">
    with blessed Joseph, her Spouse, <br class="sline">
with your blessed Apostles and glorious Martyrs <br class="sline">
<!-- <span class="red1">(</span>with Saint <span class="red1">N.</span> - the Saint of the day or Patron Saint<span class="red1">)</span><br class="sline"> -->
and with all the Saints, <br class="sline">
on whose constant intercession in your presence <br class="sline">
we rely for unfailing help. </p>

<p class="calibre6">May this Sacrifice of our reconciliation, <br class="sline">
    we pray, O Lord,<br class="sline">
advance the peace and salvation of all the world. <br class="sline">
Be pleased to confirm in faith and charity <br class="sline">
your pilgrim Church on earth, <br class="sline">
with your servant Francis our Pope and Wilton our Bishop, <br class="sline">
the Order of Bishops, all the clergy, <br class="sline">
and the entire people you have gained for your own. </p>

<p class="calibre6">Listen graciously to the prayers of this family, <br class="sline">
whom you have summoned before you: <br class="sline">
in your compassion, O merciful Father, <br class="sline">
gather to yourself all your children <br class="sline">
scattered throughout the world. </p>

<!-- <p class="response"><a href="split_328.htm#EP3D1">In Masses for the Dead.</a></p> -->

<p class="calibre6">To our departed brothers and sisters <br class="sline">
    and to all who were pleasing to you <br class="sline">
    at their passing from this life, <br class="sline">
    give kind admittance to your kingdom. <br class="sline">
    There we hope to enjoy for ever the fullness of your glory </p>

<p class="rubric">He joins his hands. </p>

<p class="calibre6">through Christ our Lord, <br class="sline">
through whom you bestow on the world all that is good. </p>

<p class="rubric">114. He takes the chalice and the paten with the host and, raising both, he says: </p>

<p class="calibre6">Through him, and with him, and in him, <br class="sline">
O God, almighty Father, <br class="sline">
in the unity of the Holy Spirit, <br class="sline">
all glory and honor is yours, <br class="sline">
for ever and ever.</p>

<p class="rubric">The people acclaim: </p>
