<p class="calibre6">The Lord be with you.</p>

<p class="response">And with your spirit.</p>

<p class="calibre6">Lift up your hearts.</p>

<p class="response">We lift them up to the Lord.</p>

<p class="calibre6">Let us give thanks to the Lord our God.</p>

<p class="response">It is right and just.</p>

<p class="calibre6">It is truly right and just that we should always give you thanks, Lord, holy Father, almighty and eternal God. </p>

<p class="calibre6">For you do not cease to spur us on to possess
a more abundant life and, being rich in mercy, you constantly offer pardon and
call on sinners to trust in your forgiveness alone. </p>

<p class="calibre6">Never did you turn away from us, and, though
time and again we have broken your covenant, you have bound the human family to
yourself through Jesus your Son, our Redeemer, with a new bond of love so tight
that it can never be undone. </p>

<p class="calibre6">Even now you set before your people a time of grace and reconciliation, and, as they turn back to you in spirit, you grant
them hope in Christ Jesus and a desire to be of service to all, while they
entrust themselves more fully to the Holy Spirit. </p>

<p class="calibre6">And so, filled with wonder, we extol the
power of your love, and, proclaiming our joy at the salvation that comes from
you, we join in the heavenly hymn of countless hosts, as without end we
acclaim: </p>

<p class="all">Holy, Holy, Holy Lord God of hosts.
Heaven and earth are full of your glory. Hosanna in the highest. Blessed is he
who comes in the name of the Lord. Hosanna in the highest.</p>

<p class="rubric">The Priest, with hands extended,
says: </p>

<p class="calibre6">You are indeed Holy, O Lord, <br class="wordsection"/>
and from the world’s beginning are ceaselessly at work, <br class="wordsection"/>
so that the human race may become holy, <br class="wordsection"/>
just as you yourself are holy. </p>

<p class="rubric">He joins his hands and, holding them extended over the offerings, says: </p>

<p class="calibre6">Look, we pray, upon your people’s offerings <br class="wordsection"/>
and pour out on them the power of your Spirit, </p>

<p class="rubric">He joins his hands and makes the
Sign of the Cross once over the bread and chalice together, saying: </p>

<p class="calibre6">that they may become the Body and <span class="red1">+</span> Blood </p>

<p class="rubric">He joins his hands. </p>

<p class="calibre6">of your beloved Son, Jesus Christ, <br class="wordsection"/>
in whom we, too, are your sons and daughters. <br class="wordsection"/>
Indeed, though we once were lost <br class="wordsection"/>
and could not approach you, <br class="wordsection"/>
you loved us with the greatest love: <br class="wordsection"/>
for your Son, who alone is just, <br class="wordsection"/>
handed himself over to death, <br class="wordsection"/>
and did not disdain to be nailed for our sake <br class="wordsection"/>
to the wood of the Cross. </p>

<p class="calibre6">But before his arms were outstretched <br class="wordsection"/>
between heaven and earth, <br class="wordsection"/>
to become the lasting sign of your covenant, <br class="wordsection"/>
he desired to celebrate the Passover with his disciples. </p>

<p class="rubric">In the formulas that follow, the
words of the Lord should be pronounced clearly and distinctly, as the nature of these words requires. </p>

<p class="calibre6">As he ate with them, </p>

<p class="rubric">He takes the bread and, holding
it slightly raised above the altar, continues: </p>

<p class="calibre6">he took bread and, giving you thanks, <br class="wordsection"/>
he said the blessing, <br class="wordsection"/>
broke the bread and gave it to them, saying: </p>

<p class="rubric">He bows slightly. </p>

<p class="calibre6">Take this, all of you, and eat of it, for this is my body, which will be given up for you. </p>

<p class="rubric">He shows the consecrated host to
the people, places it again on the paten, and genuflects in adoration. </p>

<p class="rubric">After this, he continues: </p>

<p class="calibre6">In a similar way, when supper was ended, <br class="wordsection"/>
knowing that he was about to reconcile all things in himself <br class="wordsection"/>
through his Blood to be shed on the Cross, </p>

<p class="rubric">He takes the chalice and,
holding it slightly raised above the altar, continues: </p>

<p class="calibre6">he took the chalice, <br class="wordsection"/>
filled with the fruit of the vine, <br class="wordsection"/>
and once more giving you thanks, <br class="wordsection"/>
handed the chalice to his disciples, saying: </p>

<p class="rubric">He bows slightly. </p>

<p class="calibre6">Take this, all of you, and drink from it, for this is the chalice of my blood, the blood of the new and eternal covenant, which will be poured out for you and for many for the forgiveness of sins.  </p>

<p class="calibre6">Do this in memory of me.</p>

<p class="rubric">He shows the chalice to the
people, places it on the corporal, and genuflects in adoration. </p>

<p class="rubric">Then he says: </p>

<p class="calibre6">The mystery of faith. </p>

<p class="rubric">And the people continue,
acclaiming: </p>

<p class="response">We proclaim your Death, O
Lord, <br class="wordsection"/>
and profess your Resurrection until you come again. </p>

<p class="rubric">or: </p>

<p class="response">When we eat this Bread and
drink this Cup, <br class="wordsection"/>
we proclaim your Death, O Lord, until you come again. </p>

<p class="rubric">or: </p>

<p class="response">Save us, Saviour of the world,
<br class="wordsection"/>
for by your Cross and Resurrection you have set us free. </p>

<p class="rubric">Then the Priest, with hands extended, says: </p>

<p class="calibre6">Therefore, as we celebrate <br class="wordsection"/>
the memorial of your Son Jesus Christ, <br class="wordsection"/>
who is our Passover and our surest peace, <br class="wordsection"/>
we celebrate his Death and Resurrection from the dead, <br class="wordsection"/>
and looking forward to his blessed Coming, <br class="wordsection"/>
we offer you, who are our faithful and merciful God, <br class="wordsection"/>
this sacrificial Victim <br class="wordsection"/>
who reconciles to you the human race. </p>

<p class="calibre6">Look kindly, most compassionate Father, <br class="wordsection"/>
on those you unite to yourself by the Sacrifice of your Son, <br class="wordsection"/>
and grant that, by the power of the Holy Spirit, <br class="wordsection"/>
as they partake of this one Bread and one Chalice, <br class="wordsection"/>
they may be gathered into one Body in Christ, <br class="wordsection"/>
who heals every division. </p>

<p class="calibre6">Be pleased to keep us always <br class="wordsection"/>
in communion of mind and heart, <br class="wordsection"/>
together with <span class="red1">Francis</span> our Pope and Wilton our
Bishop.<span class="red1">*</span><br class="wordsection"/>
Help us to work together <br class="wordsection"/>
for the coming of your Kingdom, <br class="wordsection"/>
until the hour when we stand before you, <br class="wordsection"/>
Saints among the Saints in the halls of heaven, <br class="wordsection"/>
with the Blessed Virgin Mary, Mother of God, <br class="wordsection"/>
the blessed Apostles and all the Saints, <br class="wordsection"/>
and with our deceased brothers and sisters, <br class="wordsection"/>
whom we humbly commend to your mercy. </p>

<p class="calibre6">Then, freed at last from the wound of corruption <br class="wordsection"/>
and made fully into a new creation, <br class="wordsection"/>
we shall sing to you with gladness </p>

<p class="rubric">He joins his hands. </p>

<p class="calibre6">the thanksgiving of Christ, who lives for all
eternity. </p>

<p class="rubric">He takes the chalice and the
paten with the host and, raising both, he says: </p>

<p class="calibre6">Through him, and with him, and in him, <br class="wordsection"/>
O God, almighty Father, <br class="wordsection"/>
in the unity of the Holy Spirit, <br class="wordsection"/>
all glory and honour is yours, <br class="wordsection"/>
for ever and ever.</p>

<p class="rubric">The people acclaim: </p>

<p class="response">Amen. | <a href="split_347.htm#CR">Then follows the Communion Rite.</a></p>
