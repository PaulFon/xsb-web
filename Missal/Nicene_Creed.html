<h3>Nicene Creed </h3>

<p>I believe in one God,<br class="sline">
the Father almighty, <br class="sline">
maker of heaven and earth,<br class="sline">
of all things visible and invisible.</p>

<p>I believe in one Lord Jesus Christ, <br class="sline">
the Only Begotten Son of God, <br class="sline">
born of the Father before all ages. <br class="sline">
God from God, Light from Light, <br class="sline">
true God from true God, <br class="sline">
begotten, not made, consubstantial with the Father; <br class="sline">
through him all things were made. <br class="sline">
For us men and for our salvation <br class="sline">
he came down from heaven, <br class="sline">
and by the Holy Spirit was incarnate of the Virgin Mary, <br class="sline">
and became man.</p>

<p>For our sake he was crucified under Pontius Pilate, <br class="sline">
he suffered death and was buried, <br class="sline">
and rose again on the third day <br class="sline">
in accordance with the Scriptures. <br class="sline">
He ascended into heaven <br class="sline">
    and is seated at the right hand of the Father.<br class="sline">
He will come again in glory to judge the living and the dead <br class="sline">
and his kingdom will have no end.</p>

<p>I believe in the Holy Spirit, the Lord, the giver of life, <br class="sline">
who proceeds from the Father and the Son, <br class="sline">
who with the Father and the Son is adored and glorified, <br class="sline">
who has spoken through the prophets.</p>

<p>I believe in one, holy, catholic and apostolic Church. <br class="sline">
I confess one Baptism for the forgiveness of sins <br class="sline">
and I look forward to the resurrection of the dead <br class="sline">
and the life of the world to come. <br class="sline">
R. Amen. </p>
