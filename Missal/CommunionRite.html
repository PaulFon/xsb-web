<p class="rubric">124. After the chalice and paten
have been set down, the Priest, with hands joined, says: </p>

<p class="calibre6">At the Savior’s command <br class="sline">
and formed by divine teaching, we dare to say: <span class="opt">[pray]</span></p>

<p class="rubric">He extends his hands and,
together with the people, continues: </p>

<p class="all">Our Father, who art in heaven, <br class="sline">
hallowed be thy name; <br class="sline">
thy kingdom come, <br class="sline">
thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven. <br class="sline">
Give us this day our daily bread, <br class="sline">
and forgive us our trespasses, <br class="sline">
as we forgive those who trespass against us; <br class="sline">
and lead us not into temptation, <br class="sline">
but deliver us from evil. </p>

<p class="rubric">125. With hands extended, the Priest alone continues, saying: </p>

<p class="calibre6">Deliver us, Lord, we pray, from every evil, <br class="sline">
graciously grant peace in our days, <br class="sline">
that, by the help of your mercy, <br class="sline">
we may be always free from sin and safe from all distress, <br class="sline">
as we await the blessed hope <br class="sline">
and the coming of our Savior, Jesus Christ. </p>

<p class="rubric">He joins his hands. The people
conclude the prayer, acclaiming: </p>

<p class="response">For the kingdom, <br class="sline">
the power and the glory are yours now and for ever. </p>

<p class="rubric">126. Then the Priest, with hands extended, says aloud: </p>

<p class="calibre6">Lord Jesus Christ, who said to your Apostles: <br class="sline">
Peace I leave you, my peace I give you; <br class="sline">
look not on our sins, but on the faith of your Church, <br class="sline">
and graciously grant her peace and unity <br class="sline">
in accordance with your will. </p>

<p class="rubric">He joins his hands. </p>

<p class="calibre6">Who live and reign for ever and ever. </p>

<p class="rubric">The people reply: </p>

<p class="response">Amen.</p>

<p class="rubric">127. The Priest, turned towards
the people, extending and then joining his hands, adds: </p>

<p class="calibre6">The peace of the Lord be with you always. </p>

<p class="rubric">The people reply: </p>

<p class="response">And with your spirit. </p>

<p class="rubric">128. Then, if appropriate, the
Deacon, or the Priest, adds: </p>

<p class="calibre6">Let us offer each other the sign of peace. </p>

<p class="rubric">And all offer one another a sign, in keeping with local customs, that expresses peace, communion, and charity. The Priest gives the sign of peace to a Deacon or minister. </p>

<p class="rubric"><a id="CR2"></a>129. Then he takes the host, breaks it over the paten, and places a small piece in the chalice saying quietly: </p>

<p class="quietly">May this mingling of the Body and Blood of our Lord Jesus Christ bring eternal life to us who receive it.</p>

<p class="rubric">130. Meanwhile the following is sung or said: </p>

<p class="all">Lamb of God, you take away the sins of the world, have mercy on us. <br class="sline">
Lamb of God, you take away the sins of the world, have mercy on us. <br class="sline">
Lamb of God, you take away the sins of the world, grant us peace. </p>

<p class="rubric">The invocation may even be repeated several times if the fraction is prolonged. Only the final time, however, is “grant us peace” said. </p>

<p class="rubric">131. Then the Priest, with hands joined, says quietly: </p>

<p class="quietly">Lord
Jesus Christ, Son of the living God, who, <br class="sline">
by the will of the Father and the work of the Holy Spirit, <br class="sline">
through your Death gave life to the world, <br class="sline">
free me by this, your most holy Body and Blood, <br class="sline">
from all my sins and from every evil; <br class="sline">
keep me always faithful to your commandments, <br class="sline">
and never let me be parted from you. </p>

<p class="rubric">or:
</p>

<p class="quietly">May the receiving of your Body and Blood, Lord Jesus Christ, <br class="sline">
not bring me to judgment and condemnation, <br class="sline">
but through your loving mercy be for me <br class="sline">
protection in mind and body and a healing remedy. </p>

<p class="rubric">132.
The Priest genuflects, takes the host and, holding it slightly raised above the
paten or above the chalice, while facing the people, says aloud: </p>

<p class="calibre6">Behold the
Lamb of God,<br class="sline">
behold him who takes away the sins of the world. <br class="sline">
Blessed are those called to the supper of the Lamb. </p>

<p class="rubric">And together with the people he adds once: </p>

<p class="all">Lord,
I am not worthy <br class="sline">
that you should enter under my roof, <br class="sline">
but only say the word and my soul shall be healed. </p>

<p class="rubric">133.
The Priest, facing the altar, says quietly: </p>

<p class="quietly">May
the Body of Christ keep me safe for eternal life. </p>

<p class="rubric">And he reverently consumes the Body of Christ. Then he takes the chalice and says quietly: </p>

<p class="quietly">May the Blood of Christ keep me safe for eternal life. </p>

<p class="rubric">And he reverently consumes the Blood of Christ. </p>

<!--<p class="rubric1"><a href="split_000.htm#ToC">Table of Contents</a></p> -->

<p class="rubric">134. After this, he takes the paten or ciborium and approaches the communicants. The
Priest raises a host slightly and shows it to each of the communicants, saying: </p>

<p class="calibre6">The Body of Christ. </p>

<p class="rubric">The communicant replies: </p>

<p class="response">Amen. </p>

<p class="rubric">And receives Holy Communion. If a Deacon also distributes Holy Communion, he does so in the same manner.<br class="sline">
135. If any are present who are to receive Holy Communion under both kinds, the rite described in the proper place is to be followed. <br class="sline">
136. While the Priest is receiving the Body of Christ, the Communion Chant begins. <br class="sline">
137. When the distribution of Communion is over, the Priest or a Deacon or an acolyte purifies the paten over the chalice and also the chalice itself. <br class="sline">While he carries out the purification, the Priest says quietly: </p>

<p class="quietly">What has passed our lips as food, O Lord, may we possess in purity of heart, that
what has been given to us in time may be our healing for eternity. </p>

<p class="rubric">138. Then the Priest may return to the chair. If appropriate, a sacred silence may be observed for a while, or a psalm or other canticle of praise or a hymn may be sung. <br class="sline">
139. Then, standing at the altar or at the chair and facing the people, with hands joined, the Priest says: </p>

<p class="calibre6">Let us pray. </p>

<p class="rubric">All pray in silence with the Priest for a while, unless silence has just been observed. Then the Priest, with hands extended, says the Prayer after Communion, at the end of which the people acclaim: </p>

<p class="response">Amen. </p>
