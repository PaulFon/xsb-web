<p class="rubric">116. It is not permitted to
change the Preface of this Eucharistic Prayer because of the structure of the
Prayer itself, which presents a summary of the history of salvation. </p>

<p class="rubric">117.
The Priest, with hands extended, says: </p>

<p class="calibre6">We give you praise, Father most holy, <br class="wordsection"/>
for you are great and you have fashioned all your works <br class="wordsection"/>
in wisdom and in love. <br class="wordsection"/>
You formed man in your own image <br class="wordsection"/>
and entrusted the whole world to his care, <br class="wordsection"/>
so that in serving you alone, the Creator, <br class="wordsection"/>
he might have dominion over all creatures. <br class="wordsection"/>
And when through disobedience he had lost your friendship, <br class="wordsection"/>
you did not abandon him to the domain of death. <br class="wordsection"/>
For you came in mercy to the aid of all, <br class="wordsection"/>
so that those who seek might find you. <br class="wordsection"/>
Time and again you offered them covenants <br class="wordsection"/>
and through the prophets taught them to look forward to salvation. </p>

<p class="calibre6">And you so loved the world, Father most holy,
<br class="wordsection"/>
that in the fullness of time<br class="wordsection"/>
you sent your Only Begotten Son to be our Savior. <br class="wordsection"/>
Made incarnate by the Holy Spirit <br class="wordsection"/>
and born of the Virgin Mary, <br class="wordsection"/>
he shared our human nature in all things but sin. <br class="wordsection"/>
To the poor he proclaimed the good news of salvation, <br class="wordsection"/>
to prisoners, freedom, <br class="wordsection"/>
and to the sorrowful of heart, joy. <br class="wordsection"/>
To accomplish your plan, <br class="wordsection"/>
he gave himself up to death, <br class="wordsection"/>
and, rising from the dead, <br class="wordsection"/>
he destroyed death and restored life. </p>

<p class="calibre6">And that we might live no longer for
ourselves <br class="wordsection"/>
but for him who died and rose again for us, <br class="wordsection"/>
he sent the Holy Spirit from you, Father, <br class="wordsection"/>
as the first fruits for those who believe, <br class="wordsection"/>
so that, bringing to perfection his work in the world, <br class="wordsection"/>
he might sanctify creation to the full. </p>

<p class="rubric">118.
He joins his hands and, holding them extended over the offerings, says: </p>

<p class="calibre6">Therefore, O Lord, we pray: <br class="wordsection"/>
may this same Holy Spirit <br class="wordsection"/>
graciously sanctify these offerings, </p>

<p class="rubric">He joins his hands and makes the
Sign of the Cross once over the bread and chalice together, saying: </p>

<p class="calibre6">that they may become <br class="wordsection"/>
the Body and <span class="red1">+</span> Blood of our Lord Jesus Christ </p>

<p class="rubric">He joins his hands. </p>

<p class="calibre6">for the celebration of this great mystery, <br class="wordsection"/>
which he himself left us as an eternal covenant. </p>

<p class="rubric">119. In the formulas that
follow, the words of the Lord should be pronounced clearly and distinctly, as
the nature of these words requires. </p>

<p class="calibre6">For when the hour had come <br class="wordsection"/>
for him to be glorified by you, Father most holy, <br class="wordsection"/>
having loved his own who were in the world, <br class="wordsection"/>
he loved them to the end: <br class="wordsection"/>
and while they were at supper, </p>

<p class="rubric">He takes the bread and, holding
it slightly raised above the altar, continues: </p>

<p class="calibre6">he took bread, blessed and broke it, <br class="wordsection"/>
and gave it to his disciples, saying, </p>

<p class="rubric">He bows slightly. </p>

<p class="calibre6">Take this, all of you, and eat of it, for this is my body, which will be given up for you. </p>

<p class="rubric">He shows the consecrated host to
the people, places it again on the paten, and genuflects in adoration. </p>

<p class="rubric">120. After this, he continues: </p>

<p class="calibre6">In a similar way, </p>

<p class="rubric">He takes the chalice and,
holding it slightly raised above the altar, continues: </p>

<p class="calibre6">taking the chalice filled with the fruit of the vine, <br class="wordsection"/>
he gave thanks, and gave the chalice to his disciples, saying: </p>

<p class="rubric">He bows slightly. </p>

<p class="calibre6">Take this, all of you, and drink from it, for this is the chalice of my blood, the blood of the new and eternal covenant, which will be poured out for you and for many for the forgiveness of sins.  </p>

<p class="calibre6">Do this in memory of me.</p>

<p class="rubric">He shows the chalice to the
people, places it on the corporal, and genuflects in adoration. </p>

<p class="rubric">121.
Then he says: </p>

<p class="calibre6">The mystery of faith. </p>

<p class="rubric">And the people continue,
acclaiming: </p>

<p class="response">We proclaim your Death, O
Lord, <br class="wordsection"/>
and profess your Resurrection until you come again. </p>

<p class="rubric">or: </p>

<p class="response">When we eat this Bread and
drink this Cup, <br class="wordsection"/>
we proclaim your Death, O Lord, until you come again. </p>

<p class="rubric">or: </p>

<p class="response">Save us, Savior of the world,
<br class="wordsection"/>
for by your Cross and Resurrection you have set us free. </p>

<p class="rubric">122.
Then, with hands extended, the Priest says: </p>

<p class="calibre6">Therefore, O Lord, as we now celebrate the
memorial of our redemption, we remember Christ’s Death <br class="wordsection"/>
and his descent to the realm of the dead, <br class="wordsection"/>
we proclaim his Resurrection <br class="wordsection"/>
and his Ascension to your right hand, <br class="wordsection"/>
and, as we await his coming in glory, <br class="wordsection"/>
we offer you his Body and Blood, <br class="wordsection"/>
the sacrifice acceptable to you <br class="wordsection"/>
which brings salvation to the whole world. </p>

<p class="calibre6">Look, O Lord, upon the Sacrifice <br class="wordsection"/>
which you yourself have provided for your Church, <br class="wordsection"/>
and grant in your loving kindness to all who partake <br class="wordsection"/>
of this one Bread and one Chalice that, <br class="wordsection"/>
gathered into one body by the Holy Spirit, <br class="wordsection"/>
they may truly become a living sacrifice in Christ <br class="wordsection"/>
to the praise of your glory. </p>

<p class="calibre6">Therefore, Lord, remember now all for whom we offer this sacrifice: especially your servant <span class="red1">Francis</span> our Pope, <span class="red1">N.</span> our Bishop,Wilton </span> and the whole Order of Bishops, <br class="wordsection"/>
all the clergy, those who take part in this offering, <br class="wordsection"/>
those gathered here before you, your entire people, <br class="wordsection"/>
and all who seek you with a sincere heart. </p>

<p class="rubric">* Mention may be made here of the Coadjutor Bishop, or Auxiliary Bishops, as noted in the General Instruction
of the Roman Missal, no. 149. </p>

<p class="calibre6">Remember also those who have died in the
peace of your Christ <br class="wordsection"/>
and all the dead, whose faith you alone have known.</p>

<p class="calibre6">To all of us, your children, grant, O merciful Father, that we may enter into a heavenly
inheritance with the Blessed Virgin Mary, Mother of God,<br class="wordsection"/>
with blessed Joseph, her Spouse, <br class="wordsection"/>
and with your Apostles and Saints in your kingdom. <br class="wordsection"/>
There, with the whole of creation, <br class="wordsection"/>
freed from the corruption of sin and death, <br class="wordsection"/>
may we glorify you through Christ our Lord, </p>

<p class="rubric">He joins his hands. </p>

<p class="calibre6">through whom you bestow on the world all that
is good. </p>

<p class="rubric">123.
He takes the chalice and the paten with the host and, raising both, he says: </p>

<p class="calibre6">Through him, and with him, and in him, <br class="wordsection"/>
O God, almighty Father, <br class="wordsection"/>
in the unity of the Holy Spirit, <br class="wordsection"/>
all glory and honor is yours, <br class="wordsection"/>
for ever and ever. </p>

<p class="rubric">The people acclaim: </p>
